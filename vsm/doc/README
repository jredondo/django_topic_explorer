This directory contains the source files to build vsm documentation
with Sphinx. The Makefile has been customized to facilitate updating
the documentation hosted as github pages.

To update the github pages automatically, invoke

$ make gh-pages

in this directory.

To see what this does concretely, inspect Makefile. In summary, this
command will do the following:

* build the html documentation in a temporary subdirectory `build`;

* clone the vsm github repo in a temporary subdirectory `vsm-gh-pages'
  and checkout the gh-pages branch;

* (!) remove almost everything in that branch;

* move the newly built documentation to `vsm-gh-pages`;

* add, commit and push the new files (you may need to give your
  credentials);

* remove the subdirectories `build` and `vsm-gh-pages`.

Currently, this procedure has no special error-handling. If it doesn't
complete, you may have to clean up the temporary subdirectories
yourself.
