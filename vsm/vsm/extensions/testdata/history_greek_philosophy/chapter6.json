["CHAPTER VI\n\nTHE ATOMISTS\n\n_Anaxagoras and the cosmos--Mind in nature--The seeds of existence_\n\n\n[129]\n\nI. ANAXAGORAS.--Anaxagoras was born at Clazomenae, a city of Ionia,\nabout the year 500 B.C.  At the age of twenty he removed to Athens, of\nwhich city Clazomenae was for some time a dependency.  This step on his\npart may have been connected with the circumstances attending the great\ninvasion of Greece by Xerxes in the year 480.  For Xerxes drew a large\ncontingent of his army from the Ionian cities which he had subdued, and\nmany who were unwilling to serve against their mother-country may have\ntaken refuge about that time in Athens.  At Athens he resided for\nnearly fifty years, and during that period became the friend and\nteacher of many eminent men, among the rest of Pericles, the great\nAthenian [118] statesman, and of Euripides, the dramatist.  Like most\nof the Ionian philosophers he had a taste for mathematics and\nastronomy, as well as for certain practical applications of\nmathematics.  Among other books he is said to have written a treatise\non the art {53} of scene-designing for the stage, possibly to oblige\nhis friend and pupil Euripides.  In his case, as in that of his\npredecessors, only fragments of his philosophic writings have been\npreserved, and the connection of certain portions of his teaching as\nthey have come down to us remains somewhat uncertain.\n\n[119]\n\nWith respect to the constitution of the universe we have the following:\n\"Origination and destruction are phrases which are generally\nmisunderstood among the Greeks.  Nothing really is originated or\ndestroyed; the only processes which actually take place are combination\nand separation of elements already existing.  [120] These elements we\nare to conceive as having been in a state of chaos at first, infinite\nin number and infinitely small, forming in their immobility a confused\nand characterless unity.  About this chaos was spread the air and\naether, infinite also in the multitude of their particles, and\ninfinitely extended.  Before separation commenced there was no clear\ncolour or appearance in anything, whether of moist or dry, of hot or\ncold, of bright or dark, but only an infinite number of the seeds of\nthings, having concealed in them all manner of forms and colours and\nsavours.\"\n\nThere is a curious resemblance in this to the opening verses of\nGenesis, \"The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon\nthe face of the deep.\"  Nor is the next step in his philosophy without\nits resemblance to that in the Biblical record.  [122] As summarised by\nDiogenes Laertius it takes this form, \"All things were as one: then\ncometh Mind, and by division brought all things into order.\"  [121]\n\"Conceiving,\" as Aristotle puts it, \"that the original elements of\nthings had no power to generate or develop out of themselves things as\nthey exist, philosophers were forced by the facts themselves to seek\nthe immediate cause of this development.  They were unable to believe\nthat fire, or earth, or any such principle was adequate to account for\nthe order and beauty visible in the frame of things; nor did they think\nit possible to attribute these to mere innate necessity or chance.\n_One_ (Anaxagoras) observing how in living creatures Mind is the\nordering force, declared that in nature also this must be the cause of\norder and beauty, and in so declaring he seemed, when compared with\nthose before him, as one sober amidst a crowd of babblers.\"\n\n[122]\n\nElsewhere, however, Aristotle modifies this commendation.\n\"Anaxagoras,\" he says, \"uses Mind only as a kind of last resort,\ndragging it in when he fails otherwise to account for a phenomenon, but\nnever thinking of it else.\"  And in the _Phaedo_ Plato makes Socrates\nspeak of the high hopes with which he had taken to the works of\nAnaxagoras, and how grievously he had been disappointed.  \"As I\nproceeded,\" he says, \"I found my philosopher altogether forsaking Mind\nor any other principle of order, and having {55} recourse to air, and\naether, and water, and other eccentricities.\"\n\nAnaxagoras, then, at least on this side of his teaching, must be\nconsidered rather as the author of a phrase than as the founder of a\nphilosophy.  The phrase remained, and had a profound influence on\nsubsequent philosophies, but in his own hands it was little more than a\ndead letter.  His immediate interest was rather in the variety of\nphenomena than in their conceived principle of unity; he is\ntheoretically, perhaps, 'on the side of the angels,' in practice he is\na materialist.\n\n[12]\n\nMind he conceived as something apart, sitting throned like Zeus upon\nthe heights, giving doubtless the first impulse to the movement of\nthings, but leaving them for the rest to their own inherent tendencies.\nAs distinguished from them it was, he conceived, the one thing which\nwas absolutely pure and unmixed.  All things else had intermixture with\nevery other, the mixtures increasing in complexity towards the centre\nof things.  On the outmost verge were distributed the finest and least\ncomplex forms of things--the sun, the moon, the stars; the more dense\ngathering together, to form as it were in the centre of the vortex, the\nearth and its manifold existences.  By the intermixture of air and\nearth and water, containing in themselves the infinitely varied seeds\nof things, plants and animals were {56} developed.  The seeds\nthemselves are too minute to be apprehended by the senses, but we can\ndivine their character by the various characters of the visible things\nthemselves, each of these having a necessary correspondence with the\nnature of the seeds from which they respectively were formed.\n\n[128]\n\nThus for a true apprehension of things sensation and reason are both\nnecessary--sensation to certify to the apparent characters of objects,\nreason to pass from these to the nature of the invisible seeds or atoms\nwhich cause those characters.  Taken by themselves our sensations are\nfalse, inasmuch as they give us only combined impressions, yet they are\na necessary stage towards the truth, as providing the materials which\nreason must separate into their real elements.\n\nFrom this brief summary we may gather that Mind was conceived, so to\nspeak, as placed at the _beginning_ of existence, inasmuch as it is the\nfirst originator of the vortex motions of the atoms or seeds of things;\nit was conceived also at the _end_ of existence as the power which by\nanalysis of the data of sensation goes back through the complexity of\nactual being to the original unmingled or undeveloped nature of things.\nBut the whole process of nature itself between these limits Anaxagoras\nconceived as a purely mechanical or at least physical development, the\nuncertainty of his view as between these two alternative ways of\nconsidering it being {57} typified in his use of the two expressions\n_atoms_ and _seeds_.  The analogies of this view with those of modern\nmaterialism, which finds in the ultimate molecules of matter \"the\npromise and the potency of all life and all existence,\" need not be\nhere enlarged upon.\n\nAfter nearly half a century's teaching at Athens Anaxagoras was\nindicted on a charge of inculcating doctrines subversive of religion.\nIt is obvious enough that his theories left no room for the popular\nmythology, but the Athenians were not usually very sensitive as to the\nbearing of mere theories upon their public institutions.  It seems\nprobable that the accusation was merely a cloak for political\nhostility.  Anaxagoras was the friend and intimate of Pericles, leader\nof the democratic party in the state, and the attack upon Anaxagoras\nwas really a political move intended to damage Pericles.  As such\nPericles himself accepted it, and the trial became a contest of\nstrength, which resulted in a partial success and a partial defeat for\nboth sides.  Pericles succeeded in saving his friend's life, but the\nopposite party obtained a sentence of fine and banishment against him.\nAnaxagoras retired to Lampsacus, a city on the Hellespont, and there,\nafter some five years, he died.\n\n\n\n\n{58}\n"]
