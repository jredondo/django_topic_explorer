["CHAPTER XX\n\nARISTOTLE (_concluded_)\n\n_God and necessity--The vital principle--Soul as realisation--Function\nand capacity--His method_\n\n\nThroughout Aristotle's physical philosophy the [334] same conception\nruns: \"All animals in their fully developed state require two members\nabove all--one whereby to take in nourishment, the other whereby to get\nrid of what is superfluous.  For no animal can exist or grow without\nnourishment.  And there is a third member in them all half-way between\nthese, in which resides the principle of their life.  This is the\nheart, which all blood-possessing animals have.  From it comes the\narterial system which Nature has made hollow to contain the liquid\nblood.  The situation of the heart is a commanding one, being near the\nmiddle and rather above than below, and rather towards the front than\nthe back.  For Nature ever establishes that which is most honourable in\nthe most honourable places, unless some supreme necessity overrules.\nWe see this most clearly in the case of man; but the same tendency for\nthe heart to occupy the centre is seen also in {200} other animals,\nwhen we regard only that portion of their body which is essential, and\nthe limit of this is at the place where superfluities are removed.  The\nlimbs are arranged differently in different animals, and are not among\nthe parts essential to life; consequently animals may live even if\nthese are removed. . . .  Anaxagoras says that man is the wisest of\nanimals because he possesses hands.  It would be more reasonable to say\nthat he possesses hands because he is the wisest.  For the hands are an\ninstrument; and Nature always assigns an instrument to the one fitted\nto use it, just as a sensible man would.  For it is more reasonable to\ngive a flute to a flute-player than to confer on a man who has some\nflutes the art of playing them.  To that which is the greater and\nhigher she adds what is less important, and not _vice vers\u00e2_.\nTherefore to the creature fitted to acquire the largest number of\nskills Nature assigned the hand, the instrument useful for the largest\nnumber of purposes\" (Arist.  _De Part. An._ iv. p. 10).\n\n[332]\n\nAnd in the macrocosm, the visible and invisible world about us, the\nsame conception holds: \"The existence of God is an eternally perfect\nentelechy, a life everlasting.  In that, therefore, which belongs to\nthe divine there must be an eternally perfect movement.  Therefore the\nheavens, which are as it were the body of the Divine, are in form a\nsphere, of {201} necessity ever in circular motion.  Why then is not\nthis true of every portion of the universe?  Because there must of\nnecessity be a point of rest of the circling body at the centre.  Yet\nthe circling body cannot rest either as a whole or as regards any part\nof it, otherwise its motion could not be eternal, which by nature it\nis.  Now that which is a violation of nature cannot be eternal, but the\nviolation is posterior to that which is in accordance with nature, and\nthus the unnatural is a kind of displacement or degeneracy from the\nnatural, taking the form of a coming into being.\n\n\"Necessity then requires earth, as the element standing still at the\ncentre.  Now if there must be earth, there must be fire.  For if one of\ntwo opposites is natural or necessary, the other must be necessary too,\neach, in fact, implying the necessity of the other.  For the two have\nthe same substantial basis, only the positive form is naturally prior\nto the negative; for instance, warm is prior to cold.  And in the same\nway motionlessness and heaviness are predicated in virtue of the\nabsence of motion and lightness, _i.e._ the latter are essentially\nprior.\n\n\"Further, if there are fire and earth, there must also be the elements\nwhich lie between these, each having an antithetic relation to each.\nFrom this it follows that there must be a process of coming into being,\nbecause none of these elements can be eternal, {202} but each affects,\nand is affected by each, and they are mutually destructive.  Now it is\nnot to be argued that anything which can be moved can be eternal,\nexcept in the case of that which by its own nature has eternal motion.\nAnd if coming into being must be predicated of these, then other forms\nof change can also be predicated\" (Arist. _De Coelo_, ii. p. 3).\n\nThis passage is worth quoting as illustrating, not only Aristotle's\nconception of the divine entelechy, but also the ingenuity with which\nhe gave that appearance of logical completeness to the vague and\nill-digested scientific imaginations of the time, which remained so\nevil an inheritance for thousands of years.  It is to be observed, in\norder to complete Aristotle's theory on this subject, that the four\nelements, Earth, Water, Air, Fire, are all equally in a world which is\n\"contrary to nature,\" that is, the world of change, of coming into\nbeing, and going out of being.  Apart from these there is the element\nof the Eternal Cosmos, which is \"in accordance with nature,\" having its\nown natural and eternal motion ever the same.  This is the fifth or\ndivine element, the aetherial, by the schoolmen translated _Quinta\nEssentia_, whence by a curious degradation we have our modern word\nQuintessence, of that which is the finest and subtlest extract.\n\nStill more clearly is the organic conception carried {203} out in\nAristotle's discussion of the Vital principle or Soul in the various\ngrades of living creatures and in man.  It will be sufficient to quote\nat length a chapter of Aristotle's treatise on the subject (_De Anima_,\nii. p. 1) in which this fundamental conception of Aristotle's\nphilosophy is very completely illustrated:--\n\n\"Now as to Substance we remark that this is one particular category\namong existences, having three different aspects.  First there is, so\nto say, the raw material or Matter, having in it no definite character\nor quality; next the Form or Specific character, in virtue of which the\nthing becomes namable; and third, there is the Thing or Substance which\nthese two together constitute.  The Matter is, in other words, the\n_potentiality_ of the thing, the Form is the _realisation_ of that\npotentiality.  We may further have this realisation in two ways,\ncorresponding in character to the distinction between _knowledge_\n(which we have but are not necessarily using) and actual\n_contemplation_ or mental perception.\n\n\"Among substances as above defined those are most truly such which we\ncall _bodily objects_, and among these most especially objects which\nare the products of nature, inasmuch as all other bodies must be\nderived from them.  Now among such natural objects some are possessed\nof life, some are not; by _life_ I mean a process of spontaneous\nnourishment, growth, and decay.  Every natural {204} object having life\nis a substance compounded, so to say, of several qualities.  It is, in\nfact, a bodily substance defined in virtue of its having life.  Between\nthe living body thus defined and the Soul or Vital principle, a marked\ndistinction must be drawn.  The body cannot be said to 'subsist in'\nsomething else; rather must we say that it is the matter or substratum\nin which something else subsists.  And what we mean by the soul is just\nthis substance in the sense of the _form_ or specific character that\nsubsists in the natural body which is _potentially_ living.  In other\nwords, the Soul is substance as _realisation_, only, however, of such a\nbody as has just been defined.  Recalling now the distinction between\nrealisation as possessed knowledge and as actual contemplation, we\nshall see that in its essential nature the Soul or Vital principle\ncorresponds rather with the first than with the second.  For both sleep\nand waking depend on the Soul or Life being there, but of these waking\nonly can be said to correspond with the active form of knowledge; sleep\nis rather to be compared with the state of having without being\nimmediately conscious that we have.  Now if we compare these two states\nin respect of their priority of development in a particular person, we\nshall see that the state of latent possession comes first.  We may\ntherefore define the Soul or Vital principle as _The earliest {205}\nrealisation (entelechy) of a natural body having in it the potentiality\nof life_.\n\n\"To every form of organic structure this definition applies, for even\nthe parts of plants are organs, although very simple ones; thus the\nouter leaf is a protection to the pericarp, and the pericarp to the\nfruit.  Or, again, the roots are organs bearing an analogy to the mouth\nin animals, both serving to take in food.  Putting our definition,\nthen, into a form applicable to every stage of the Vital principle, we\nshall say that _The Soul is the earliest realisation of a natural body\nhaving organisation_.\n\n\"In this way we are relieved from the necessity of asking whether Soul\nand body are one.  We might as well ask whether the wax and the\nimpression are one, or, in short, whether the _matter_ of any object\nand that whereof it is the matter or substratum are one.  As has been\npointed out, unity and substantiality may have several significations,\nbut the truest sense of both is found in _realisation_.\n\n\"The general definition of the Soul or Vital principle above given may\nbe further explained as follows.  The Soul is the _rational_ substance\n(or function), that is to say, it is that which gives essential meaning\nand reality to a body as knowable.  Thus if an axe were a _natural_\ninstrument or organ, its rational substance would be found in its\nrealisation of what an axe means; this would be its _soul_.  Apart\n{206} from such realisation it would not be an axe at all, except in\nname.  Being, however, such as it is, the axe remains an axe\nindependently of any such realisation.  For the statement that the Soul\nis the _reason_ of a thing, that which gives it essential meaning and\nreality, does not apply to such objects as an axe, but only to natural\nbodies having power of spontaneous motion (including growth) and rest.\n\n\"Or we may illustrate what has been said by reference to the bodily\nmembers.  If the eye be a living creature, _sight_ will be its soul,\nfor this is the _rational_ substance (or function) of the eye.  On the\nother hand, the eye itself is the _material_ substance in which this\nfunction subsists, which function being gone, the eye would no longer\nbe an eye, except in name, just as we can speak of the eye of a statue\nor of a painted form.  Now apply this illustration from a part of the\nbody to the whole.  For as any one sense stands related to its organ,\nso does the vital sense in general to the whole sensitive organism as\nsuch, always remembering that we do not mean a dead body, but one which\nreally has in it potential life, as the seed or fruit has.  Of course\nthere is a form of realisation to which the name applies in a specially\nfull sense, as when the axe is actually cutting, the eye actually\nseeing, the man fully awake.  But the Soul or Vital principle\ncorresponds rather with the _function_ of sight, or the _capacity_ for\ncutting which {207} the axe has, the body, on the other hand, standing\nin a relation of _potentiality_ to it.  Now just as the eye may mean\nboth the actual organ or pupil, and also the function of sight, so also\nthe living creature means both the body and the soul.  We cannot,\ntherefore, think of body apart from soul, or soul apart from body.  If,\nhowever, we regard the soul as composed of parts, we can see that the\nrealisation to which we give the name of soul is in some cases\nessentially a realisation of certain parts of the body.  We may,\nhowever, conceive the soul as in other aspects separable, in so far as\nthe realisation cannot be connected with any bodily parts.  Nay, we\ncannot be certain whether the soul may not be the realisation or\nperfection of the body as the sailor is of his boat.\"\n\nObserve that at the last Aristotle, though very tentatively, leaves an\nopening for immortality, where, as in the case of man, there are\nfunctions of the soul, such as philosophic contemplation, which cannot\nbe related to bodily conditions.  He really was convinced that in man\nthere was a portion of that diviner aether which dwelt eternally in the\nheavens, and was the ever-moving cause of all things.  If there was in\nman a _passive_ mind, which became all things, as all things through\nsensation affected it, there was also, Aristotle argued, a _creative_\nmind in man, which is above, and unmixed with, that which it\napprehends, {208} gives laws to this, is essentially prior to all\nparticular knowledge, is therefore eternal, not subject to the\nconditions of time and space, consequently indestructible.\n\nFinally, as a note on Aristotle's method, one may observe in this\npassage, _first_, Aristotle's use of 'defining examples,' the wax, the\nleaf and fruit, the axe, the eye, etc.; _second_, his practice of\ndeveloping his distinctions gradually, Form and Matter in the abstract,\nthen in substances of every kind, then in natural bodies, then in\norganic bodies of various grades, in separate organs, in the body as a\nwhole, and in the Soul as separable in man; and _thirdly_, his method\nof approaching completeness in thought, by apparent contradictions or\nqualifications, which aim at meeting the complexity of nature by an\nequally organised complexity of analysis.  To this let us simply add,\nby way of final characterisation, that in the preceding pages we have\ngiven but the merest fragment here and there of Aristotle's vast\naccomplishment.  So wide is the range of his ken, so minute his\nobservation, so subtle and complicated and allusive his illustrations,\nthat it is doubtful if any student of his, through all the centuries in\nwhich he has influenced the world, ever found life long enough to\nfairly and fully grasp him.  Meanwhile he retains his grasp upon us.\nForm and matter, final and efficient causes, potential and actual\nexistences, {209} substance, accident, difference, genus, species,\npredication, syllogism, deduction, induction, analogy, and multitudes\nof other joints in the machinery of thought for all time, were forged\nfor us in the workshop of Aristotle.\n\n\n\n\n{210}\n"]
