["CHAPTER XIX\n\nARISTOTLE (_continued_)\n\n_Realisation and reminiscence--The crux of philosophy--Reason in\neducation--The chief good--Origin of communities_\n\n\nIf we look closely at this conception of Aristotle's we shall see that\nit has a nearer relation to the Platonic doctrine of Ideas, and even to\nthe doctrine of Reminiscence, than perhaps even Aristotle himself\nrealised.  The fundamental conception of Plato, it will be remembered,\nis that of an eternally existing 'thought of God,' in manifold forms or\n'ideas,' which come into the consciousness of men in connection with or\non occasion of sensations, which are therefore in our experience later\nthan the sensations, but which we nevertheless by reason recognise as\nnecessarily prior to the sensations, inasmuch as it is through these\nideas alone that the sensations are knowable or namable at all.  Thus\nthe final end for man is by contemplation and 'daily dying to the world\nof sense,' to come at last into the full inheritance in conscious\nknowledge of that 'thought of God' which was latent from the first in\nhis soul, and of which in its fulness God Himself is eternally and\nnecessarily possessed.\n\n{188}\n\n[311]\n\nThis is really Aristotle's idea, only Plato expresses it rather under a\npsychological, Aristotle under a vital, formula.  God, Aristotle says,\nis eternally and necessarily Entelechy, absolute realisation.  _To us_,\nthat which is first _in time_ (the individual perception) is not first\nin _essence_, or absolutely.  What is first in essence or absolutely,\nis the universal, that is, the form or idea, the datum of reason.  And\nthis distinction between time and the absolute, between our individual\nexperience and the essential or ultimate reality, runs all through the\nphilosophy of Aristotle.  The 'Realisation' of Aristotle is the\n'Reminiscence' of Plato.\n\nThis conception Aristotle extended to Thought, to the various forms of\nlife, to education, to morals, to politics.\n\n_Thought_ is an entelechy, an organic whole, in which every process\nconditions and is conditioned by every other.  If we begin with\nsensation, the sensation, blank as regards predication, has relations\nto that which is infinitely real,--the object, the real thing before\nus,--which relations science will never exhaust.  If we start from the\nother end, with the datum of thought, consciousness, existence, mind,\nthis is equally blank as regards predication, yet it has relations to\nanother existence infinitely real,--the subject that thinks,--which\nrelations religion and morality and sentiment and love will never\nexhaust.  Or, as {189} Aristotle and as common sense prefers to do, if\nwe, with our developed habits of thought and our store of accumulated\ninformation, choose to deal with things from a basis midway between the\ntwo extremes, in the ordinary way of ordinary people, we shall find\nboth processes working simultaneously and in organic correlation.  That\nis to say, we shall be increasing the _individuality_ of the objects\nknown, by the operation of true thought and observation in the\ndiscovery of new characters or qualities in them; we shall be\nincreasing by the same act the _generality_ of the objects known, by\nthe discovery of new relations, new genera under which to bring them.\nIndividualisation and generalisation are only opposed, as mutually\nconditioning factors of the same organic function.\n\n[316]\n\nThis analysis of thought must be regarded rather as a paraphrase of\nAristotle than as a literal transcript.  He is hesitating and obscure,\nand at times apparently self-contradictory.  He has not, any more than\nPlato, quite cleared himself of the confusion between the mutually\ncontrary individual and universal in _propositions_, and the\norganically correlative individual and universal in _things as known_.\nBut on the whole the tendency of his analysis is towards an\napprehension of the true realism, which neither denies matter in favour\nof mind nor mind in favour of matter, but recognises that both mind and\nmatter are organically correlated, and ultimately identical.\n\n{190}\n\nThe crux of philosophy, so far as thus apprehended by Aristotle, is no\nlonger in the supposed dualism of mind and matter, but there is a crux\nstill.  What is the meaning of this 'Ultimately'?  Or, putting it in\nAristotle's formula, Why this relation of potentiality and actuality?\nWhy this eternal coming to be, even if the coming to be is no\nunreasoned accident, but a coming to be of that which is vitally or in\ngerm _there_?  Or theologically, Why did God make the world?  Why this\ngroaning and travailing of the creature?  Why this eternal 'By and by'\nwherein all sin is to disappear, all sorrow to be consoled, all the\nclashings and the infinite deceptions of life to be stilled and\nsatisfied?  An illustration of Aristotle's attempt to answer this\nquestion will be given later on (p. 201).  That the answer is a failure\nneed not surprise us.  If we even now 'see only as in a glass darkly'\non such a question, we need not blame Plato or Aristotle for not seeing\n'face to face.'\n\n[326]\n\n_Life_ is an entelechy, not only abstractedly, as already shown (above,\np. 186), but in respect of the varieties of its manifestations.  We\npass from the elementary life of mere growth common to plants and\nanimals, to the animal life of impulse and sensation, thence we rise\nstill higher to the life of rational action which is the peculiar\nfunction of man.  Each is a _potentiality_ to that which is immediately\nabove it; in {191} other words, each contains in germ the possibilities\nwhich are realised in that stage which is higher.  Thus is there a\ntouch of nature which makes the whole world kin, a purpose running\nthrough all the manifestations of life; each is a preparation for\nsomething higher.\n\n[339]\n\n_Education_ is in like manner an entelechy.  For what is the\n_differentia_, the distinguishing character of the life of man?\nAristotle answers, the possession of reason.  It is the action of\nreason upon the desires that raises the life of man above the brutes.\nThis, observe, is not the restraining action of something wholly alien\nto the desires, which is too often how Plato represents the matter.\nThis would be to lose the dynamic idea.  The desires, as Aristotle\ngenerally conceives them, are there in the animal life, prepared, so to\nspeak, to receive the organic perfection which reason alone can give\nthem.  Intellect, on the other hand, is equally in need of the desires,\nfor thought without desire cannot supply motive.  If intellect is\n_logos_ or reason, desire is that which is fitted to be obedient to\nreason.\n\nIt will be remembered that the question to which Plato addressed\nhimself in one of his earlier dialogues, already frequently referred\nto, the _Meno_, was the teachableness of Virtue; in that dialogue he\ncomes to the conclusion that Virtue is teachable, but that there are\nnone capable of teaching it; for the {192} wise men of the time are\nguided not by knowledge but by right opinion, or by a divine instinct\nwhich is incommunicable.  Plato is thus led to seek a machinery of\neducation, and it is with a view to this that he constructs his ideal\n_Republic_.  Aristotle took up this view of the state as educative of\nthe individual citizens, and brought it under the dynamic formula.  In\nthe child reason is not actual; there is no rational law governing his\nacts, these are the immediate result of the strongest impulse.  Yet\nonly when a succession of virtuous acts has formed the virtuous habit\ncan a man be said to be truly good.  How is this process to begin?  The\nanswer is that the reason which is only latent or dynamic in the child\nis actual or realised in the parent or teacher, or generally in the\ncommunity which educates the child.  The law at first then is imposed\non the child from without, it has an appearance of unnaturalness, but\nonly an appearance.  For the law is there in the child, prepared, as he\ngoes on in obedience, gradually to answer from within to the summons\nfrom without, till along with the virtuous habit there emerges also\ninto the consciousness of the child, no longer a child but a man, the\napprehension of the law as his own truest nature.\n\nThese remarks on education are sufficient to show that in Morals also,\nas conceived by Aristotle, there is a law of vital development.  It may\nbe {193} sufficient by way of illustration to quote the introductory\nsentences of Aristotle's _Ethics_, in which the question of the nature\nof the chief good is, in his usual tentative manner, discussed: \"If\nthere be any end of what we do which we desire for itself, while all\nother ends are desired for it, that is, if we do not in every case have\nsome ulterior end (for if that were so we should go on to infinity, and\nour efforts would be vain and useless), this ultimate end desired for\nitself will clearly be the chief good and the ultimate best.  Now since\nevery activity, whether of knowing or doing, aims at some good, it is\nfor us to settle what the good is which the civic activity aims\nat,--what, in short, is the ultimate end of all 'goods' connected with\nconduct?  So far as the name goes all are pretty well agreed as to the\nanswer; gentle and simple alike declare it to be happiness, involving,\nhowever, in their minds on the one hand well-living, on the other hand,\nwell-doing.  When you ask them, however, to define this happiness more\nexactly, you find that opinions are divided, and the many and the\nphilosophers have different answers.\n\n\"But if you ask a musician or a sculptor or any man of skill, any\nperson, in fact, who has some special work and activity, what the chief\ngood is for him, he will tell you that the chief good is in the work\nwell done.  If then man has any special work or function, we may assume\nthat the chief good for man {194} will be in the well-doing of that\nfunction.  What now is man's special function?  It cannot be mere\nliving, for that he has in common with plants, and we are seeking what\nis peculiar to him.  The mere life of nurture and growth must therefore\nbe put on one side.  We come next to life as sensitive to pleasure and\npain.  But this man shares with the horse, the ox, and other animals.\nWhat remains is the life of action of a reasonable being.  Now of\nreason as it is in man there are two parts, one obeying, one possessing\nand considering.  And there are also two aspects in which the active or\nmoral life may be taken, one potential, one actual.  Clearly for our\ndefinition of the chief good we must take the moral life in its full\nactual realisation, since this is superior to the other.\n\n\"If our view thus far be correct, it follows that the chief good for\nman consists in the full realisation and perfection of the life of man\nas man, in accordance with the specific excellence belonging to that\nlife, and if there be more specific excellences than one, then in\naccordance with that excellence which is the best and the most rounded\nor complete.  We must add, however, the qualification, 'in a rounded\nlife.'  For one swallow does not make a summer, nor yet one day.  And\nso one day or some brief period of attainment is not sufficient to make\na man happy and blest.\"\n\n{195}\n\nThe close relation of this to the teaching of Socrates and Plato need\nhardly be insisted on, or the way in which he correlates their ideas\nwith his own conception of an actualised perfection.\n\n[340]\n\nAristotle then proceeds to a definition of the 'specific excellence' or\nvirtue of man, which is to be the standard by which we decide how far\nhe has fully and perfectly realised the possibilities of his being.  To\nthis end he distinguishes in man's nature three modes of existence:\nfirst, _feelings_ such as joy, pain, anger; second, _potentialities_ or\ncapacities for such feelings; third, _habits_ which are built upon\nthese potentialities, but with an element of reason or deliberation\nsuperadded.  He has no difficulty in establishing that the virtue of\nman must be a habit.  And the test of the excellence of that habit, as\nof every other developed capacity, will be twofold; it will make the\nworker good, it will cause him to produce good work.\n\nSo far Aristotle's analysis of virtue is quite on the lines of his\ngeneral philosophy.  Here, however, he diverges into what seems at\nfirst a curiously mechanical conception.  Pointing out that in\neverything quantitative there are two extremes conceivable, and a\n_mean_ or average between them, he proceeds to define virtue as a mean\nbetween two extremes, a mean, however, having relation to no mere\nnumerical standard, but having reference _to us_.  In this last {196}\nqualification he perhaps saves his definition from its mechanical turn,\nwhile he leaves himself scope for much curious and ingenious\nobservation on the several virtues regarded as means between two\nextremes.  He further endeavours to save it by adding, that it is\n\"defined by reason, and as the wise man would define it.\"\n\nReason then, as the impersonal ruler,--the wise man, as the\npersonification of reason,--this is the standard of virtue, and\ntherefore also of happiness.  How then shall we escape an externality\nin our standard, divesting it of that binding character which comes\nonly when the law without is also recognised and accepted as the law\nwithin?  The answer of Aristotle, as of his predecessors, is that this\nwill be brought about by wise training and virtuous surroundings, in\nshort, by the civic community being itself good and happy.  Thus we get\nanother dynamic relation; for regarded as a member of the body politic\neach individual becomes a potentiality along with all the other\nmembers, conditioned by the state of which he and they are members,\nbrought gradually into harmony with the reason which is in the state,\nand in the process realising not his own possibilities only, but those\nof the community also, which exists only in and through its members.\nThus each and all, in so far as they realise their own well-being by\nthe perfect development of the virtuous {197} habit in their lives,\ncontribute _ipso facto_ to the supreme end of the state, which is the\nperfect realisation of the whole possibilities of the total organism,\nand consequently of every member of it.\n\n[342]\n\nThe _State_ therefore is also an entelechy.  For man is not made to\ndwell alone.  \"There is first the fact of sex; then the fact of\nchildren; third, the fact of variety of capacity, implying variety of\nposition, some having greater powers of wisdom and forethought, and\nbeing therefore naturally the rulers; others having bodily powers\nsuitable for carrying out the rulers' designs, and being therefore\nnaturally subjects.  Thus we have as a first or simplest community the\nfamily, next the village, then the full or perfect state, which,\nseeking to realise an absolute self-sufficiency within itself, rises\nfrom mere living to well-living as an aim of existence.  This higher\nexistence is as natural and necessary as any simpler form, being, in\nfact, the end or final and necessary perfection of all such lower forms\nof existence.  Man therefore is by the natural necessity of his being a\n'political animal,' and he who is not a citizen,--that is, by reason of\nsomething peculiar in his nature and not by a mere accident,--must\neither be deficient or something superhuman.  And while man is the\nnoblest of animals when thus fully perfected in an ordered community,\non the other hand when deprived of law and justice he is the very\nworst.  {198} For there is nothing so dreadful as lawlessness armed.\nAnd man is born with the arms of thought and special capacities or\nexcellences, which it is quite possible for him to use for other and\ncontrary purposes.  And therefore man is the most wicked and cruel\nanimal living when he is vicious, the most lustful and the most\ngluttonous.  The justice which restrains all this is a civic quality;\nand law is the orderly arrangement of the civic community\" (Arist.\n_Pol_. i. p. 2).\n\n\n\n\n{199}\n"]
