["CHAPTER X\n\nTHE SOPHISTS (_concluded_)\n\n_Nothing knowable--The solitude of scepticism--The lawlessness of\nscepticism--The good in scepticism_\n\n\n[183]\n\nGorgias was perhaps even more eminent a Sophist than Protagoras.  He\nwas a native of Leontini in Sicily, and came to Athens in the year 427\nB.C. on a public embassy from his native city.  The splendid reputation\nfor political and rhetorical ability, which preceded him to Athens, he\nfully justified both by his public appearances before the Athenian\nassembly, and by the success of his private instructions to the crowds\nof wealthy young men who resorted to him.  He dressed in magnificent\nstyle, and affected a lofty and poetical manner of speech, which\noffended the more critical, but which pleased the crowd.\n\n[181]\n\nHe also, like Protagoras, published a treatise in which he expounded\nhis fundamental principles, and like Protagoras, he preceded it with a\nstriking if somewhat ironical title, and an apophthegm in which he\nsummarised his doctrine.  The title of his work was _Of the\nNon-Existent_, that is, _Of Nature_, and {93} his dictum, \"Nothing\nexists, or if anything exists, it cannot be apprehended by man, and\neven if it could be apprehended, the man who apprehended it could not\nexpound or explain it to his neighbour.\"  In support of this strange\ndoctrine, Gorgias adopted the quibbling method of argument which had\nbeen applied with some success to dialectical purposes by Zeno,\nMelissus, and others (see above, pp. 44 _sqq._)\n\n[185]\n\nHis chief argument to prove the first position laid down by him\ndepended on a double and ambiguous use of the word _is_; \"That which is\nnot, _is_ the non-existent: the word _is_ must, therefore, be\napplicable to it as truly as when we say That which is, _is_;\ntherefore, being is predicable of that which is not.\"  So conversely he\nproved not-being to be predicable of that which is.  And in like manner\nhe made away with any possible assertions as to the finite or infinite,\nthe eternal or created, nature of that which is.  Logic could supply\nhim with alternative arguments from whatever point he started, such as\nwould seem to land the question in absurdity.  Hence his first position\nwas (he claimed) established, that 'Nothing is.'\n\nTo prove the second, that even if anything is, it cannot be known to\nman, he argued thus: \"If what a man thinks is not identical with what\nis, plainly what is cannot be thought.  And that what a man thinks is\nnot identical with what is can be {94} shown from the fact that\nthinking does not affect the facts.  You may imagine a man flying, or a\nchariot coursing over the deep, but you do not find these things to\noccur because you imagine them.  Again, if we assume that what we think\nis identical with what is, then it must be impossible to think of what\nis not.  But this is absurd; for we can think of such admittedly\nimaginary beings as Scylla and Chimaera, and multitudes of others.\nThere is therefore no necessary relation between our thoughts and any\nrealities; we may believe, but we cannot prove, which (if any) of our\nconceptions have relation to an external fact and which have not.\"\n\n[187]\n\nNor thirdly, supposing any man had obtained an apprehension of what is\nreal, could he possibly communicate it to any one else.  If a man saw\nanything, he could not possibly by verbal description make clear what\nit is he sees to a man who has never seen.  And so if a man has not\nhimself the apprehension of reality, mere words from another cannot\npossibly give him any idea of it.  He may imagine he has the same idea\nas the speaker, but where is he going to get the common test by which\nto establish the identity?\n\nWithout attempting to follow Gorgias further, we can see plainly enough\nthe object and purport of the whole doctrine.  Its main result is to\n_isolate_.  It isolates each man from his fellows; he cannot tell {95}\nwhat they know or think, they cannot reach any common ground with him.\nIt isolates him from nature; he cannot tell what nature is, he cannot\ntell whether he knows anything of nature or reality at all.  It\nisolates him from himself; he cannot tell for certain what relation\nexists (if any) between what he imagines he perceives at any moment and\nany remembered or imagined previous experiences; he cannot be sure that\nthere ever were any such experiences, or what that self was (if\nanything) which had them, or whether there was or is any self\nperceiving anything.\n\nLet us imagine the moral effect on the minds of the ablest youth of\nGreece of such an absolute collapse of belief.  The philosophic\nscepticism did not deprive them of their appetites or passions; it did\nnot in the least alter their estimate of the prizes of success, or the\ndesirability of wealth and power.  All it did was to shatter the\ninvisible social bonds of reverence and honour and truth and justice,\nwhich in greater or less degree act as a restraining force upon the\npurely selfish appetites of men.  Not only belief in divine government\ndisappeared, but belief in any government external or internal; justice\nbecame a cheating device to deprive a man of what was ready to his\ngrasp; good-faith was stupidity when it was not a more subtle form of\ndeceit; morality was at best a mere convention which a man might cancel\nif {96} he pleased; the one reality was the appetite of the moment, the\none thing needful its gratification; society, therefore, was universal\nwar, only with subtler weapons.\n\nOf course Protagoras and Gorgias were only notable types of a whole\nhorde of able men who in various ways, and with probably less clear\nnotions than these men of the drift or philosophic significance of\ntheir activity, helped all over Greece in the promulgation of this new\ngospel of self-interest.  Many Sophists no doubt troubled themselves\nvery little with philosophical questions; they were 'agnostics,'\nknow-nothings; all they professed to do was to teach some practical\nskill of a verbal or rhetorical character.  They had nothing to do with\nthe nature or value of ideals; they did not profess to say whether any\nend or aim was in itself good or bad, but given an end or aim, they\nwere prepared to help those who hired them to acquire a skill which\nwould be useful towards attaining it.\n\nBut whether a philosophy or ultimate theory of life be expressly stated\nor realised by a nation or an individual, or be simply ignored by them,\nthere always is some such philosophy or theory underlying their action,\nand that philosophy or theory tends to work itself out to its logical\nissue in action, whether men openly profess it or no.  And the theory\nof negation of law in nature or in man which underlay {97} the\nsophistic practice had its logical and necessary effect on the social\nstructure throughout Greece, in a loosening of the bonds of religion,\nof family reverence and affection, of patriotism, of law, of honour.\nThucydides in a well-known passage (iii. 82) thus describes the\nprevalent condition of thought in his own time, which was distinctively\nthat of the sophistic teaching: \"The common meaning of words was turned\nabout at men's pleasure; the most reckless bravo was deemed the most\ndesirable friend; a man of prudence and moderation was styled a coward;\na man who listened to reason was a good-for-nothing simpleton.  People\nwere trusted exactly in proportion to their violence and\nunscrupulousness, and no one was so popular as the successful\nconspirator, except perhaps one who had been clever enough to outwit\nhim at his own trade, but any one who honestly attempted to remove the\ncauses of such treacheries was considered a traitor to his party.  As\nfor oaths, no one imagined they were to be kept a moment longer than\noccasion required; it was, in fact, an added pleasure to destroy your\nenemy if you had managed to catch him through his trusting to your\nword.\"\n\nThese are the words not of Plato, who is supposed often enough to allow\nhis imagination to carry him beyond his facts about the Sophists as\nabout others, nor are they the words of a satiric poet such as {98}\nAristophanes.  They are the words of the most sober and philosophic of\nGreek historians, and they illustrate very strikingly the tendency,\nnay, the absolute necessity, whereby the theories of philosophers in\nthe closet extend themselves into the market-place and the home, and\nfind an ultimate realisation of themselves for good or for evil in the\n'business and bosoms' of the common crowd.\n\nIt is not to be said that the individualistic and iconoclastic movement\nwhich the Sophists represented was wholly bad, or wholly unnecessary,\nany more (to again quote a modern instance) than that the French\nRevolution was.  There was much, no doubt, in the traditional religion\nand morality of Greece at that time which represented obsolete and\nantiquated conditions, when every city lived apart from its neighbours\nwith its own narrow interests and local cults and ceremonials.  Greece\nwas ceasing to be an unconnected crowd of little separate communities;\nunconsciously it was preparing itself for a larger destiny, that of\nconqueror and civiliser of East and West.  This scepticism, utterly\nuntenable and unworkable on the lines extravagantly laid down by its\nleading teachers, represented the birth of new conditions of thought\nand action adapted to the new conditions of things.  On the surface,\nand accepted literally, it seemed to deny the possibility of knowledge;\nit threatened to destroy humanity and {99} civilisation.  But its\nstrength lay latent in an implied denial only of what was merely\ntraditional; it denied the finality of purely Greek preconceptions; it\nwas laying the foundations of a broader humanity.  It represented the\nclaim of a new generation to have no dogma or assumption thrust on it\nby mere force, physical or moral.  \"_I_ too am a man,\" it said; \"_I_\nhave rights; _my_ reason must be convinced.\"  This is the fundamental\nthought at the root of most revolutions and reformations and revivals,\nand the thought is therefore a necessary and a just one.\n\nUnfortunately it seems to be an inevitable condition of human affairs\nthat nothing new, however necessary or good can come into being out of\nthe old, without much sorrow and many a birth-pang.  The extravagant,\nthe impetuous, the narrow-minded on both sides seize on their points of\ndifference, raise them into battle-cries, and make what might be a\npeaceful regeneration a horrid battlefield of contending hates.  The\nChrist when He comes brings not peace into the world, but a sword.  And\nmen of evil passions and selfish ambitions are quick on both sides to\nmake the struggle of old and new ideals a handle for their own\nindulgence or their own advancement; the Pharisees and the Judases\nbetween them make the Advent in some of its aspects a sorry spectacle.\n\nA reconciler was wanted who should wed what {100} was true in the new\ndoctrine of individualism with what was valuable in the old doctrine of\nuniversal and necessary truth; who should be able to say, \"Yes, I\nacknowledge that your individual view of things must be reckoned with,\nand mine, and everybody else's; and for that very reason do I argue for\na universal and necessary truth, because the very truth for you as an\nindividual is just this universal.\"  The union and identification of\nthe Individual and Universal,--this paradox of philosophy is the\ndoctrine of Socrates.\n\n\n\n\n{101}\n"]
