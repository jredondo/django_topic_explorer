["CHAPTER XI\n\nSOCRATES\n\n_The crisis of philosophy--Philosophic midwifery--The wisest of\nmen--The gadfly of Athens--Justice, beauty, utility--Virtue is\nknowledge_\n\n\nThe sophistic teaching having forced philosophy to descend into the\npractical interests and personal affairs of men, it followed that any\nfurther step in philosophy, any reaction against the Sophists, could\nonly begin from the moral point of view.  Philosophy, as an analysis of\nthe data of perception or of nature, had issued in a social and moral\nchaos.  Only by brooding on the moral chaos could the spirit of truth\nevoke a new order; only out of the moral darkness could a new\nintellectual light be made to shine.  The social and personal anarchy\nseemed to be a _reductio ad absurdum_ of the philosophy of nature; if\never the philosophy of nature was to be recovered it must be through a\nrevision of the theory of morals.  If it could be proved that the\ndoctrine of individualism, of isolation, which the analysis of a\nProtagoras or a Gorgias had reached, was not only _unlivable_ but\nunthinkable,--carried the seeds of its own destruction, theoretical as\nwell as practical, within {102} itself,--then the analysis of\n_perception_, from which this moral individualism issued, might itself\nbe called to submit to revision, and a stable point of support in the\nmoral world might thus become a centre of stability for the\nintellectual and the physical also.\n\nBy a perfectly logical process, therefore, the crisis of philosophy\nproduced in Greece through the moral and social chaos of the sophistic\nteaching had two issues, or perhaps we may call it one issue, carried\nout on the one side with a less, on the other side with a greater\ncompleteness.  The less complete reaction from sophistic teaching\nattempted only such reconstruction of the moral point of view as should\nrecover a law or principle of general and universally cogent character,\nwhereon might be built anew a _moral_ order without attempting to\nextend the inquiry as to a universal principle into the regions of\nabstract truth or into physics.  The more complete and logical\nreaction, starting, indeed, from a universal principle in morals,\nundertook a logical reconstruction on the recovered universal basis all\nalong the line of what was knowable.\n\nTo Socrates it was given to recover the lost point of stability in the\nworld of morals, and by a system of attack, invented by himself, to\ndeal in such a manner with the anarchists about him as to prepare the\nway for his successors, when the time was ripe for a more extended\nexposition of the new point of {103} view.  Those who in succession to\nhim worked out a more limited theory of law, mainly or exclusively in\nthe world of morals, only were called the _Incomplete Socratics_.\nThose who undertook to work it out through the whole field of the\nknowable, the _Complete Socratics_, were the two giants of philosophy,\nPlato and Aristotle.\n\nGreek philosophy then marks with the life of Socrates a parting of the\nways in two senses: _first_, inasmuch as with him came the reaction\nfrom a physical or theoretical philosophy, having its issue in a moral\nchaos; and _second_, inasmuch as from him the two great streams of\nlater philosophy issued--the one a philosophy of law or universals in\n_action_, the other a philosophy of law or universals in _thought_ and\n_nature_ as well.\n\nSocrates, son of Sophroniscus a sculptor and Phaenarete a midwife, was\nborn at Athens in or about the year 469 B.C.  His parents were probably\npoor, for Socrates is represented as having been too poor to pay the\nfees required for instruction by the Sophists of his time.  But in\nwhatever way acquired or assimilated, it is certain that there was\nlittle of the prevalent culture in cultivated Athens with which\nSocrates had not ultimately a working acquaintance.\n\nAmong a people distinguished generally for their handsome features and\nnoble proportions, Socrates was a notable exception.  His face was\nsquat and {104} round, his eyes protruding, his lips thick; he was\nclumsy and uncouth in appearance, careless of dress, a thorough\n'Bohemian,' as we should call him.  He was, however, gifted with an\nuncommon bodily vigour, was indifferent to heat and cold, by\ntemperament moderate in food and drink, yet capable on occasion of\ndrinking most people 'under the table.'  He was of an imperturbable\nhumour, not to be excited either by danger or by ridicule.  His vein of\nsarcasm was keen and trenchant, his natural shrewdness astonishing, all\nthe more astonishing because crossed with a strange vein of mysticism\nand a curious self-forgetfulness.  As he grew up he felt the visitation\nof a mysterious internal voice, to which or to his own internal\ncommunings he would sometimes be observed to listen in abstracted\nstillness for hours.  The voice within him was felt as a restraining\nforce, limiting his action in various ways, but leaving him free to\nwander about among his fellows, to watch their doings and interpret\ntheir thoughts, to question unweariedly his fellows of every class,\nhigh and low, rich and poor, concerning righteousness and justice and\ngoodness and purity and truth.  He did not enter on his philosophic\nwork with some grand general principle ready-made, to which he was\nprepared to fit the facts by hook or by crook.  Rather he compared\nhimself to his mother, the midwife; he sought to help others to {105}\nexpress themselves; he had nothing to tell them, he wanted them to tell\nhim.  This was the irony of Socrates, the eternal _questioning_, which\nin time came to mean in people's minds what the word does now.  For it\nwas hard, and grew every year harder, to convince people that so subtle\na questioner was as ignorant as he professed to be; or that the man who\ncould touch so keenly the weak point of all other men's answers, had no\nanswer to the problems of life himself.\n\nIn striking contrast, then, to the method of all previous philosophies,\nSocrates busied himself to begin with, not with some general\nintellectual _principle_, but with a multitude of different _people_,\nwith their notions especially on moral ideas, with the meaning or\nno-meaning which they attached to particular words,--in short, with the\nindividual, the particular, the concrete, the every-day.  He did not at\nall deny that he had a purpose in all this.  On the contrary, he openly\nprofessed that he was in search of the lost universal, the lost _law_\nof men's thoughts and actions.  He was convinced that life was not the\nchaos that the Sophists made out; that nobody really believed it to be\na chaos; that, on the contrary, everybody had a meaning and purport in\nhis every word and act, which could be made intelligible to himself and\nothers, if you could only get people to think out clearly what they\nreally meant.  Philosophy {106} had met her destruction in the busy\nhaunts of men; there where had been the bane, Socrates' firm faith\nsought ever and everywhere the antidote.\n\nThis simple enough yet profound and far-reaching practice of Socrates\nwas theorised in later times as a logical method, known to us as\n_Induction_, or the discovery of universal laws or principles out [195]\nof an accumulation of particular facts.  And thus Aristotle, with his\ntechnical and systematising intellect, attributes two main innovations\nin philosophy to Socrates; the _Inductive_ process of reasoning, and\nthe establishing of _General Ideas_ or Definitions upon or through this\nprocess.  This, true enough as indicating what was latent in the\nSocratic method, and what was subsequently actually developed out of it\nby Aristotle himself, is nevertheless probably an anachronism if one\nseeks to represent it as consciously present in Socrates' mind.\nSocrates adopted the method unconsciously, just because he wanted to\nget at the people about him, and through them at what they thought.  He\nwas the pioneer of Induction rather than its inventor; he created, so\nto speak, the raw material for a theory of induction and definition; he\nknew and cared nothing about such theories himself.\n\nA story which may or may not be true in fact is put in Socrates' mouth\nby Plato, as to the cause which first started him on his \"search for\ndefinitions.\"  {107} One of his friends, he tells us, named Chaerephon,\nwent to the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, and asked whether there was\nanybody wiser than Socrates.  The answer was given that there was none\nwiser.  This answer was reported to Socrates, who was much astonished,\nhis own impression being that he had no wisdom or knowledge at all.  So\nwith a view to prove the oracle wrong he went in succession to various\npeople of eminence and reputation in the various walks of\nlife,--statesmen and poets and handicraftsmen and others,--in the\nexpectation that they would show, on being questioned, such a knowledge\nof the principles on which their work was based as would prove their\nsuperior wisdom.  But to his astonishment he found one after another of\nthese men wanting in any apprehension of principles at all.  They\nseemed to work by a kind of haphazard or 'rule of thumb,' and indeed\nfelt annoyed that anything more should be expected of them.  From which\nat the last Socrates came to the conclusion that perhaps the oracle was\nright in this sense at least, that, if he himself knew nothing more\nthan his fellows, he was at least conscious of his own ignorance,\nwhereas they were not.\n\nWhether this tale may not itself be a specimen of Socrates' irony we\ncannot tell, but at all events it illustrates from another point of\nview the real meaning of Socrates' life.  He, at least, was not content\n{108} to rest in haphazard and rule of thumb; he was determined to go\non till he found out what was the law or principle of men's acts and\nwords.  The ignorance of others as to any such law or principle in\ntheir own case did not convince him that there was no such law or\nprinciple; only it was there (he thought) working unconsciously, and\ntherefore in a way defencelessly.  And so he compares himself at times\nto a gadfly, whose function it is to sting and irritate people out of\ntheir easy indifference, and force them to ask themselves what they\nwere really driving at.  Or again, he compares himself to the\ntorpedo-fish, because he tried to give people a shock whenever they\nattempted to satisfy him with shallow and unreal explanations of their\nthoughts and actions.\n\nThe disinterested self-sacrificing nobility of Socrates' life, thus\ndevoted to awakening them that sleep out of their moral torpor; the\nenmities that his keen and trenchant questionings of quacks and\npretenders of every kind induced; the devotion of some of his friends,\nthe unhappy falling away of others; the calumnies of interested\nenemies, the satires of poets; and lastly, the story of the final\nattack by an ungrateful people on their one great teacher, of his\nunjust condemnation and heroic death--all this we must pass over here.\nThe story is in outline, at least, a familiar one, and it is one of the\nnoblest in history.  What is more to {109} the purpose for us is to\nascertain how far his search for definitions was successful; how far he\nwas able to\n\n  Take arms against a sea of troubles\n  And by opposing end them;\n\nhow far, in short, he was able to evolve a law, a universal principle,\nout of the confused babel of common life and thought and speech, strong\nenough and wide enough on which to build a new order for this world, a\nnew hope for the world beyond.\n\nWe have said that Socrates made the individual and the concrete the\nfield of his search.  And not only did he look to individuals for\nlight, he looked to each individual specifically in that aspect of his\ncharacter and faculty which was most particular to himself.  That is to\nsay, if he met a carpenter, it was on his carpentering that he\nquestioned him; if a sculptor, on his practice as a sculptor; if a\nstatesman, on his statesmanship.  In short, he did not want general\nvague theories on subjects of which his interlocutors could not be\nsupposed to have any special experience or knowledge; he interrogated\neach on the subject which he knew best.\n\nAnd what struck him, in contrast to the confusion and uncertainty and\nisolation of the sophistic teaching 'in the air,' was that when you get\na man to talk on his own trade, which he _knows_, as is proved by the\nactual work he produces, you find invariably two {110} things--_first_,\nthat the skill is the man's _individual_ possession no doubt, the\nresult of inborn capacity and continuous training and practice; but\n_second_, that just in proportion to that individual skill is the man's\nconviction that his skill has reference to a _law_ higher than himself,\noutside himself.  If the man whom Socrates interviewed was a skilful\nstatesman, he would tell you he sought to produce obedience to _law_ or\nright among the citizens; if he was a skilful sculptor, he produced\n_beautiful_ things; if he was a skilful handicraftsman, he produced\n_useful_ things.  Justice, beauty, utility; these three words in\ndifferent ways illustrated the existence of something always realising\nitself no doubt in individuals and their works, but nevertheless\nexercising a governing influence upon these to such a degree that this\nideal something might be conceived as _prior_ to the individual or his\nwork; or secondly, as _inherent_ in them and giving value to them; or\nthirdly, as coming in at the end as the _perfection_ or completion of\nthem.  This law or ideal then had a threefold aspect in its own nature,\nbeing conceivable as Justice, as Beauty, as Utility; it had a threefold\naspect in relation to the works produced in accordance with it, as the\ncause _producing_, the cause _inhering_, the cause completing or\n_perfecting_.\n\nWe may therefore conceive Socrates as arguing thus: \"You clever\nSophists, when we let you take {111} us into the region of abstract\ntalk, have a knack of so playing with words that in the end we don't\nseem to know anything for certain, especially on such subjects as we\nhave hitherto thought the most important, such as God and right and\ntruth and justice and purity.  We seem to be perfectly defenceless\nagainst you; and what is more, any smart youth, whose opinion on any\npractical matter no one would think of taking, can very soon pick up\nthe trick from you, and bewilder plain people really far wiser than\nhimself by his clever argumentation; all going to prove that there is\nnothing certain, nothing real, nothing binding; nothing but opinions\nand conventions and conscious or unconscious humbug in the universe.\n\n\"But when I go and have a quiet talk with any man who really is a known\nmaster of some craft or skill, about that craft or skill, I find no\ndoubt whatever existing in his mind about there being a law, a\nsomething absolutely real and beautiful and true in connection with it.\nHe, on the contrary, lives with no other purpose or hope or desire but\nas far as he can to realise in what he works at something of this real\nand beautiful and true, which was before him, will be after him, is the\nonly valuable thing in him, but yet which honours him with the function\nof, in his day and generation, expressing it before the eyes of men.\"\n\n{112} \"Have we not here a key to the great secret?  If each man, in\nrespect of that which he knows best because he lives by it and for it,\nknows with intimate knowledge and certainty that there at least there\nis a Law working, not himself, but higher and greater than he,--have we\nnot here a hint of the truth for the universe as a whole; that there\nalso and in all its operations, great as well as small, there must be a\nLaw, a great Idea or Ideal working, which was before all things, works\nin and gives value to all things, will be the consummation of all\nthings?  Is not this what we mean by the Divine?\"\n\nThus Socrates, despising not the meaner things of life, but bending\nfrom the airy speculations of the proud to the realities which true\nlabour showed him, laid his ear, so to speak, close to the breast of\nnature, and caught there the sound of her very heart-beats.\n\n\"Virtue is knowledge,\" thus he formulated his new vision of things.\nKnowledge, yes; but _real_ knowledge; not mere head-knowledge or\nlip-knowledge, but the knowledge of the skilled man, the man who by\nobedience and teachableness and self-restraint has come to a knowledge\nevidencing itself in _works_ expressive of the law that is in him, as\nhe is in it.  _Virtue is knowledge_; on the one hand, therefore, not\nsomething in the air, unreal, intangible; but something in me, in you,\nin each man, something which you cannot handle except as individual and\n{113} in individuals; on the other hand, something more than individual\nor capricious or uncertain,--something which is absolute, over-ruling,\neternal.\n\n_Virtue is knowledge_.  And so if a man is virtuous, he is realising\nwhat is best and truest in himself, he is fulfilling also what is best\nand truest without himself.  He is free, for only the truth makes free;\nhe is obedient to law, but it is at once a law eternally valid, and a\nlaw which he dictates to himself.  And therefore virtue is teachable,\ninasmuch as the law in the teacher, perfected in him, is also the law\nin the taught, latent in him, by both individually possessed, but\npossessed by both in virtue of its being greater than both, of its\nbeing something more than individual.\n\n_Virtue is knowledge_.  And therefore the law of virtuous growth is\nexpressed in the maxim engraved on the Delphic temple, 'Know thyself.'\nKnow thyself, that is, realise thyself; by obedience and self-control\ncome to your full stature; be in fact what you are in possibility;\nsatisfy yourself, in the only way in which true self-satisfaction is\npossible, by realising in yourself the law which constitutes your real\nbeing.\n\n_Virtue is knowledge_.  And therefore all the manifold relations of\nlife,--the home, the market, the city, the state; all the multiform\nactivities of life,--labour and speech and art and literature and {114}\nlaw; all the sentiments of life,--friendship and love and reverence and\ncourage and hope,--all these are parts of a knowable whole; they are\nexpressions of law; they are Reason realising itself through\nindividuals, and in the same process realising them.\n\n\n\n\n{115}\n"]
