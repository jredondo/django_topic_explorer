["CHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE SCEPTICS AND EPICUREANS\n\n_Greek decay--The praises of Lucretius--Canonics--Physics--The proofs\nof Lucretius--The atomic soul--Mental pleasures--Natural\npleasures--Lower philosophy and higher_\n\n\nPhilosophy, equally complete, equally perfect in all its parts, had its\nfinal word in Plato and Aristotle; on the great lines of universal\nknowledge no further really original structures were destined to be\nraised by Greek hands.  We have seen a parallelism between Greek\nphilosophy and Greek politics in their earlier phases (see above, p.\n82); the same parallelism continues to the end.  Greece broke the bonds\nof her intense but narrow civic life and civic thought, and spread\nherself out over the world in a universal monarchy and a cosmopolitan\nphilosophy; but with this widening of the area of her influence\nreaction came and disruption and decay; an immense stimulus was given\non the one hand to the political activity, on the other, to the thought\nand knowledge of the world as a whole, but at the centre Greece was\n'living Greece no more,' her politics sank to the level of a dreary\nfarce, her philosophy died down to a dull and spiritless scepticism, to\nan Epicureanism {211} that 'seasoned the wine-cup with the dust of\ndeath,' or to a Stoicism not undignified yet still sad and narrow and\nstern.  The hope of the world, alike in politics and in philosophy,\nfaded as the life of Greece decayed.\n\n[356]\n\nThe first phase of the change, _Scepticism_, or Pyrrhonism, as it was\nnamed from its first teacher, need not detain us long.  Pyrrho was\npriest of Elis; in earlier life he accompanied Alexander the Great as\nfar as India, and is said to have become acquainted with certain of the\nphilosophic sects in that country.  In his sceptical doctrine he had,\nlike his predecessors, a school with its succession of teachers; but\nthe [358] world has remembered little more of him or them than two\nphrases 'suspense of judgment'--this for the intellectual side of\nphilosophy; 'impassibility'--this for the moral.  The doctrine is a\nnegation of doctrine, the idle dream of idle men; even Pyrrho once,\nwhen surprised in some sudden access of fear, confessed that it was\nhard for him 'to get rid of the man in himself.'  Vigorous men and\ngrowing nations are never agnostic.  They decline to rest in mere\nsuspense; they are extremely the opposite of impassive; they believe\nearnestly, they feel strongly.\n\n[365]\n\nA more interesting, because more positive and constructive, personality\nwas that of Epicurus.  This philosopher was born at Samos, in the year\n341 B.C., of Athenian parents.  He came to Athens in his eighteenth\nyear.  Xenocrates was then teaching at {212} the Academy, Aristotle at\nthe Lyceum, but Epicurus heard neither the one nor the other.  After\nsome wanderings he returned to Athens and set up on his [366] own\naccount as a teacher of philosophy.  He made it a matter of boasting\nthat he was a self-taught philosopher; and Cicero (_De Nat. Deor._ i.\n26) sarcastically remarks that one could have guessed as much, even if\nEpicurus had not stated it himself; as one might of the proprietor of\nan ugly house, who should boast that he had employed no architect.  The\nstyle of Epicurus was, in fact, plain and unadorned, but he seems all\nthe same to have been able to say what he meant; and few if any writers\nancient or modern have ever had so splendid a literary tribute, as\nEpicurus had from the great Roman poet Lucretius, his follower and\nexpositor.\n\n\"Glory of the Greek race,\" he says, \"who first hadst power to raise\nhigh so bright a light in the midst of darkness so profound, shedding a\nbeam on all the interests of life, thee do I follow, and in the\nmarkings of thy track do I set my footsteps now.  Not that I desire to\nrival thee, but rather for love of thee would fain call myself thy\ndisciple.  For how shall the swallow rival the swan, or what speed may\nthe kid with its tottering limbs attain, compared with the brave might\nof the scampering steed?  Thou; O father, art the discoverer of nature,\nthou suppliest to us a father's teachings, and from thy pages, {213}\nillustrious one, even as bees sip all manner of sweets along the\nflowery glades, we in like manner devour all thy golden words, golden\nand right worthy to live for ever.  For soon as thy philosophy, birth\nof thy godlike mind, hath begun to declare the origin of things,\nstraightway the terrors of the soul are scattered, earth's walls are\nbroken apart, and through all the void I see nature in the working.  I\nbehold the gods in manifestation of their power, I discern their\nblissful seats, which never winds assail nor rain-clouds sprinkle with\ntheir showers, nor snow falling white with hoary frost doth buffet, but\ncloudless aether ever wraps them round, beaming in broad diffusion of\nglorious light.  For nature supplies their every want nor aught impairs\ntheir peace of soul.  But nowhere do I see any regions of hellish\ndarkness, nor does the earth impose a barrier to our sight of what is\ndone in the void beneath our feet.  Wherefore a holy ecstasy and thrill\nof awe possess me, while thus by thy power the secrets of nature are\ndisclosed to view\" (Lucret. _De Nat. Rer._ iii, 1-30).\n\n[367]\n\nThis devotion to the memory of Epicurus on the part of Lucretius was\nparalleled by the love felt for him by his contemporaries; he had\ncrowds of followers who loved him and who were proud to learn his words\nby heart.  He seems indeed to have been a man of exceptional kindness\nand amiability, and the 'garden of Epicurus' became proverbial as {214}\na place of temperate pleasures and wise delights.  Personally we may\ntake it that Epicurus was a man of simple tastes and moderate desires;\nand indeed throughout its history Epicureanism as a rule of conduct has\ngenerally been associated with the finer forms of enjoyment, rather\nthan the more sensual.  The 'sensual sty' is a nickname, not a\ndescription.\n\n[369]\n\nPhilosophy Epicurus defined as a process of thought and reasoning\ntending to the realisation of happiness.  Arts or sciences which had no\nsuch practical end he contemned; and, as will be observed in Lucretius'\npraises of him above, even physics had but one purpose or interest, to\nfree the soul from [370] terrors of the unseen.  Thus philosophy was\nmainly concerned with conduct, _i.e._ with Ethics, but secondarily and\nnegatively with Physics, to which was appended what Epicurus called\nCanonics, or the science of testing, that is, a kind of logic.\n\n[371]\n\nBeginning with _Canonics_, as the first part of philosophy in order of\ntime, from the point of view of human knowledge, Epicurus laid it down\nthat the only source of knowledge was the senses, which gave us an\nimmediate and true perception of that which actually came into contact\nwith them.  Even the visions of madmen or of dreamers he considered\nwere in themselves true, being produced by a physical cause of some\nkind, of which these visions were the direct and immediate report.\nFalsity came in with {215} people's interpretations or imaginations\nwith respect to these sensations.\n\nSensations leave a trace in the memory, and out of similarities or\nanalogies among sensations there are developed in the mind general\nnotions or types, such as 'man,' 'house,' which are also true, because\n[373] they are reproductions of sensations.  Thirdly, when a sensation\noccurs, it is brought into relation in the mind with one or more of\nthese types or notions; this is _predication_, true also in so far as\nits elements are true, but capable of falsehood, as subsequent or\nindependent sensation may prove.  If supported or not contradicted by\nsensation, it is or may be true; if contradicted or not supported by\nsensation, it is or may be false.  The importance of this statement of\nthe canon of truth or falsehood will be understood when we come to the\nphysics of Epicurus, at the basis of which is his theory of Atoms,\nwhich by their very nature can never be directly testified to by\nsensation.\n\n[374]\n\nThis and no more was what Epicurus had to teach on the subject of\nlogic.  He had no theory of definition, or division, or ratiocination,\nor refutation, or explication; on all these matters Epicurus was, as\nCicero said, 'naked and unarmed.'  Like most self-taught or ill-taught\nteachers, Epicurus trusted to his dogmas; he knew nothing and cared\nnothing for logical defence.\n\n{216}\n\n[375]\n\nIn his _Physics_ Epicurus did little more than reproduce the doctrine\nof Democritus.  He starts from the fundamental proposition that\n'nothing can be produced from nothing, nothing can really perish.'  The\nveritable existences in nature are the Atoms, which are too minute to\nbe discernible by the senses, but which nevertheless have a definite\nsize, and cannot further be divided.  They have also a definite weight\nand form, but no qualities other than these.  There is an infinity of\nempty space; this Epicurus proves on abstract grounds, practically\nbecause a limit to space is unthinkable.  It follows that there must be\nan infinite number of the atoms, otherwise they would disperse\nthroughout the infinite void and disappear.  There is a limit, however,\nto the number of varieties among the atoms in respect of form, size,\nand weight.  The existence of the void space is proved by the fact that\nmotion takes place, to which he adds the argument that it necessarily\nexists also to separate the atoms one from another.  So far Epicurus\nand Democritus are agreed.\n\nTo the Democritean doctrine, however, Epicurus made a curious addition,\nto which he himself is said to have attached much importance.  The\nnatural course (he said) for all bodies having weight is downwards in a\nstraight line.  It struck Epicurus that this being so, the atoms would\nall travel for ever in parallel lines, and those 'clashings and\ninterminglings' of {217} atoms out of which he conceived all visible\nforms to be produced, could never occur.  He therefore laid it down\nthat the atoms _deviated_ the least little bit from the straight, thus\nmaking a world possible.  And Epicurus considered that this supposed\ndeviation of the atoms not only made a world possible, but human\nfreedom also.  In the deviation, without apparent cause, of the\ndescending atoms, the law of necessity was broken, and there was room\non the one hand for man's free will, on the other, for prayer to the\ngods, and for hope of their interference on our behalf.\n\nIt may be worth while summarising the proofs which Lucretius in his\ngreat poem, professedly following in the footsteps of Epicurus, adduces\nfor these various doctrines.\n\nEpicurus' first dogma is, 'Nothing proceeds from nothing,' that is,\nevery material object has some matter previously existing exactly equal\nin quantity to it, out of which it was made.  To prove this Lucretius\nappeals to the _order of nature_ as seen in the seasons, in the\nphenomena of growth, in the fixed relations which exist between life\nand its environment as regards what is helpful or harmful, in the\nlimitation of size and of faculties in the several species and the\nfixity of the characteristics generally in each, in the possibilities\nof cultivation and improvement of species within certain limits and\nunder certain conditions.\n\n{218}\n\nTo prove his second position, 'Nothing passes into nothing,' Lucretius\npoints out to begin with that there is a law even in destruction;\n_force_ is required to dissolve or dismember anything; were it\notherwise the world would have disappeared long ago.  Moreover, he\npoints out that it is from the elements set free by decay and death\nthat new things are built up; there is no waste, no visible lessening\nof the resources of nature, whether in the generations of living\nthings, in the flow of streams and the fulness of ocean, or in the\neternal stars.  Were it not so, infinite time past would have exhausted\nall the matter in the universe, but Nature is clearly immortal.\nMoreover, there is a correspondence between the structure of bodies and\nthe forces necessary to their destruction.  Finally, apparent\nviolations of the law, when carefully examined, only tend to confirm\nit.  The rains no doubt disappear, but it is that their particles may\nreappear in the juices of the crops and the trees and the beasts which\nfeed on them.\n\nNor need we be surprised at the doctrine that the atoms, so\nall-powerful in the formation of things, are themselves invisible.  The\nsame is true of the forest-rending blasts, the 'viewless winds' which\nlash the waves and overwhelm great fleets.  There are odours also that\nfloat unseen upon the air; there are heat, and cold, and voices.  There\nis the process of evaporation, whereby we know that the water has gone,\n{219} yet cannot see its vapour departing.  There is the gradual\ninvisible detrition of rings upon the finger, of stones hollowed out by\ndripping water, of the ploughshare in the field, and the flags upon the\nstreets, and the brazen statues of the gods whose fingers men kiss as\nthey pass the gates, and the rocks that the salt sea-brine eats into\nalong the shore.\n\nThat there is Empty Space or Void he proves by all the varied motions\non land and sea which we behold; by the porosity even of hardest\nthings, as we see in dripping caves.  There is the food also which\ndisperses itself throughout the body, in trees and cattle.  Voices pass\nthrough closed doors, frost can pierce even to the bones.  Things equal\nin size vary in weight; a lump of wool has more of void in it than a\nlump of lead.  So much for Lucretius.\n\nFor abstract theories on physics, except as an adjunct and support to\nhis moral conceptions, Epicurus seems to have had very little\ninclination.  He thus speaks of the visible universe or Cosmos.  [373]\nThe Cosmos is a sort of skyey enclosure, which holds within it the\nstars, the earth, and all visible things.  It is cut off from the\ninfinite by a wall of division which may be either rare or dense, in\nmotion or at rest, round or three-cornered or any other form.  That\nthere is such a wall of division is quite admissible, for no object of\nwhich we have observation is without its limit.  Were this wall of\ndivision to {220} break, everything contained within it would tumble\nout.  We may conceive that there are an infinite number of such Cosmic\nsystems, with inter-cosmic intervals throughout the infinity of space.\n\nHe is very disinclined to assume that similar phenomena, _e.g._\neclipses of the sun or moon, always have the same cause.  The various\naccidental implications and interminglings of the atoms may produce the\nsame effect in various ways.  In fact Epicurus has the same impatience\nof theoretical physics as of theoretical philosophy.  He is a\n'practical man.'\n\n[378]\n\nHe is getting nearer his object when he comes to the nature of the\nsoul.  The soul, like everything else, is composed of atoms, extremely\ndelicate and fine.  It very much resembles the breath, with a mixture\nof heat thrown in, sometimes coming nearer in nature to the first,\nsometimes to the second.  Owing to the delicacy of its composition it\nis extremely subject to variation, as we see in its passions and\nliability to emotion, its phases of thought and the varied experiences\nwithout which we cannot live.  It is, moreover, the chief cause of\nsensation being possible for us.  Not that it could of itself have had\nsensation, without the enwrapping support of the rest of the structure.\nThe rest of the structure, in fact, having prepared this chief cause,\ngets from it a share of what comes to it, but not a share of all which\nthe soul has.\n\nThe soul being of material composition equally {221} with the other\nportions of the bodily structure, dies of course with it, that is, its\nparticles like the rest are dispersed, to form new bodies.  There is\nnothing dreadful therefore about death, for there is nothing left to\nknow or feel anything about it.\n\nAs regards the process of sensation, Epicurus, like Democritus,\nconceived bodies as having a power of emitting from their surface\nextremely delicate images of themselves.  These are composed of very\nfine atoms, but, in spite of their tenuity, they are able to maintain\nfor a considerable time their relative form and order, though liable\nafter a time to distortion.  They fly with great celerity through the\nvoid, and find their way through the windows of the senses to the soul,\nwhich by its delicacy of nature is in sympathy with them, and\napprehends their form.\n\n[379]\n\nThe gods are indestructible, being composed of the very finest and\nsubtlest atoms, so as to have not a body, but _as it were_ a body.\nTheir life is one of perfect blessedness and peace.  They are in number\ncountless; but the conceptions of the vulgar are erroneous respecting\nthem.  They are not subject to the passions of humanity.  Anger and joy\nare alike alien to their nature; for all such feelings imply a lack of\nstrength.  They dwell apart in the inter-cosmic spaces.  As Cicero\njestingly remarks: \"Epicurus by way of a joke introduced his gods so\npure that you could see through them, {222} so delicate that the wind\ncould blow through them, having their dwelling-place outside between\ntwo worlds, for fear of breakage.\"\n\n[380]\n\nComing finally to Epicurus' theory of Ethics, we find a general\nresemblance to the doctrine of Democritus and Aristippus.  The end of\nlife is pleasure or the absence of pain.  He differs, however, from the\nCyrenaics in maintaining that not the pleasure of the moment is the\nend, but pleasure throughout the whole of life, and that therefore we\nought in our conduct to have regard to the future.  Further he denies\nthat pleasure exists only in activity, it exists equally in rest and\nquiet; in short, he places more emphasis in his definition on the\nabsence of pain or disturbance, than on the presence of positive\npleasure.  And thirdly, while the Cyrenaics maintained that bodily\npleasures and pains were the keenest, Epicurus claimed these\ncharacteristics for the pleasures of the mind, which intensified the\npresent feeling by anticipations of the future and recollections of the\npast.  And thus the wise man might be happy, even on the rack.  Better\nindeed was it to be unlucky and wise, than lucky and foolish.  In a\nsimilar temper Epicurus on his death-bed wrote thus to a friend: \"In\nthe enjoyment of blessedness and peace, on this the last day of my life\nI write this letter to you.  Strangury has supervened, and the\nextremest agony of internal {223} pains, yet resisting these has been\nmy joy of soul, as I recalled the thoughts which I have had in the\npast.\"\n\n[381]\n\nWe must note, however, that while mental pleasures counted for much\nwith the Epicureans, these mental pleasures consisted not in thought\nfor thought's sake in any form; they had nothing to do with\ncontemplation.  They were essentially connected with bodily\nexperiences; they were the memory of past, the anticipation of future,\nbodily pleasures.  For it is to be remembered that thoughts were with\nEpicurus only converted sensations, and sensations were bodily\nprocesses.  Thus every joy of the mind was conditioned by a bodily\nexperience preceding it.  Or as Metrodorus, Epicurus' disciple, defined\nthe matter: \"A man is happy when his body is in good case, and he has\ngood hope that it will continue so.\"  Directly or indirectly,\ntherefore, every happiness came back, in the rough phrase of Epicurus,\nto one's belly at last.\n\n[382]\n\nThis theory did not, however, reduce morality to bestial\nself-indulgence.  If profligate pleasures could be had free from mental\napprehensions of another world and of death and pain and disease in\nthis, and if they brought with them guidance as to their own proper\nrestriction, there would be no reason whatever to blame a man for\nfilling himself to the full of pleasures, which brought no pain or\nsorrow, that is, {224} no evil, in their train.  But (Epicurus argues)\nthis is far from being the case.  Moreover there are many pleasures\nkeen enough at the time, which are by no means pleasant in the\nremembering.  And even when we have them they bring no enjoyment to the\nhighest parts of our nature.  What those 'highest parts' are, and by\nwhat standard their relative importance is determined, Epicurus does\nnot say.  He probably meant those parts of our nature which had the\nwidest range in space and time, our faculties, namely, of memory and\nhope, of conception, of sight and hearing.\n\nMoreover there are distinctions among desires; some are both natural\nand compulsory, such as thirst; some are natural but not compulsory, as\nthe desire for dainties; some are neither natural nor compulsory, such\nas the desire for crowns or statues.  The last of these the wise man\nwill contemn, the second he will admit, but so as to retain his\nfreedom.  For independence of such things is desirable, not necessarily\nthat we may reduce our wants to a minimum, but in order that if we\ncannot enjoy many things, we may be content with few.  \"For I am\nconvinced,\" Epicurus continues, \"that they have the greatest enjoyment\nof wealth, who are least dependent upon it for enjoyment.\"\n\nThus if Epicurus did not absolutely teach simplicity of living, he\ntaught his disciples the necessity of being capable of such simplicity,\nwhich they could {225} hardly be without practice.  So that in reality\nthe doctrine of Epicurus came very near that of his opponents.  As\nSeneca the Stoic observed, \"Pleasure with him comes to be something\nvery thin and pale.  In fact that law which we declare for virtue, the\nsame law he lays down for pleasure.\"\n\nOne of the chief and highest pleasures of life Epicurus found in the\npossession of friends, who provided for each other not only help and\nprotection, but a lifelong joy.  For the 'larger friendship' of the\ncivic community, Epicurus seems to have had only a very neutral regard.\nJustice, he says, is a convention of interests, with a view of neither\nhurting or being hurt.  The wise man will have nothing to do with\npolitics, if he can help it.\n\nIn spite of much that may offend in the doctrines of Epicurus, there is\nmuch at least in the man which is sympathetic and attractive.  What one\nobserves, however, when we compare such a philosophy with that of Plato\nor Aristotle, is first, a total loss of constructive imagination.  The\nparts of the 'philosophy,' if we are so to call it, of Epicurus hang\nbadly together, and neither the Canonics nor the Physics show any real\nfaculty of serious thinking at all.  The Ethics has a wider scope and a\nmore real relation to experience if not to reason.  But it can never\nsatisfy the deeper apprehension of mankind.\n\nThe truest and most permanently valid revelations {226} of life come\nnot to the many but to the one or the few, who communicate the truth to\nthe many, sometimes at the cost of their own lives, always at the cost\nof antagonism and ridicule.  A philosophy therefore which only\nrepresents in theoretical form the average practice of the average man,\ncomes into the world still-born.  It has nothing to say; its hearers\nknow it all, and the exact value of it all, already.  And in their\nheart of hearts, many even of those who have stooped to a lower ideal,\nand sold their birthright of hopes beyond the passing hour, for a mess\nof pottage in the form of material success and easy enjoyment, have a\nlurking contempt for the preachers of what they practise; as many a\nslaveholder in America probably had for the clerical defenders of the\n'divine institution.'\n\nThere is a wasting sense of inadequacy in this 'hand-to-mouth' theory\nof living, which compels most of those who follow it to tread softly\nand speak moderately.  They are generally a little weary if not\ncynical; they don't think much of themselves or of their success; but\nthey prefer to hold on as they have begun, rather than launch out into\nnew courses, which they feel they have not the moral force to continue.\n\"May I die,\" said the Cynic, \"rather than lead a life of pleasure.\"\n\"May I die,\" says the Epicurean, \"rather than make a fool of myself.\"\nThe Idealist is to them, if not {227} a hypocrite, at least a\nvisionary,--if not a Tartuffe, at least a Don Quixote tilting at\nwindmills.  Yet even for poor Don Quixote, with all his blindness and\nhis follies, the world retains a sneaking admiration.  It can spare a\nfew or a good many of its worldly-wisdoms, rather than lose altogether\nits enthusiasms and its dreams.  And the one thing which saves\nEpicureanism from utter extinction as a theory, is invariably the\nidealism which like a 'purple patch' adorns it here and there.  No man\nand no theory is wholly self-centred.  Pleasure is supplanted by\nUtility, and Utility becomes the greatest Happiness of the greatest\nNumber, and so, as Horace says (_Ep._ I. x. 24)--\n\n  Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret,\n\nNature (like Love) thrust out of the door, will come back by the\nwindow; and the Idealism which is not allowed to make pain a pleasure,\nis required at last to translate pleasure into pains.\n\n\n\n\n{228}\n"]
