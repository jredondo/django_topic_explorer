["{1}\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE SCHOOL OF MILETUS\n\n_The question of Thales--Water the beginning of things--Soul in all\nthings--Mystery in science--Abstraction and reality--Theory of\ndevelopment_\n\n\nI. THALES.--For several centuries prior to the great Persian invasions\nof Greece, perhaps the very greatest and wealthiest city of the Greek\nworld was Miletus.  Situate about the centre of the Ionian coasts of\nAsia Minor, with four magnificent harbours and a strongly defensible\nposition, it gathered to itself much of the great overland trade, which\nhas flowed for thousands of years eastward and westward between India\nand the Mediterranean; while by its great fleets it created a new world\nof its own along the Black Sea coast.  Its colonies there were so\nnumerous that Miletus was named 'Mother of Eighty Cities.'  From Abydus\non the Bosphorus, past Sinope, and so onward to the Crimea and the Don,\nand thence round to Thrace, a busy community of colonies, mining,\nmanufacturing, ship-building, corn-raising, owned Miletus for their\nmother-city.  Its {2} marts must therefore have been crowded with\nmerchants of every country from India to Spain, from Arabia to Russia;\nthe riches and the wonders of every clime must have become familiar to\nits inhabitants.  And fitly enough, therefore, in this city was born\nthe first notable Greek geographer, the first constructor of a map, the\nfirst observer of natural and other curiosities, the first recorder of\nvarieties of custom among various communities, the first speculator on\nthe causes of strange phenomena,--Hecataeus.  His work is in great part\nlost, but we know a good deal about it from the frequent references to\nhim and it in the work of his rival and follower, Herodotus.\n\nThe city naturally held a leading place politically as well as\ncommercially.  Empire in our sense was alien to the instincts of the\nGreek race; but Miletus was for centuries recognised as the foremost\nmember of a great commercial and political league, the political\ncharacter of the league becoming more defined, as first the Lydian and\nthen the Persian monarchy became an aggressive neighbour on its borders.\n\n[8]\n\nIt was in this active, prosperous, enterprising state, and at the\nperiod of its highest activity, that Thales, statesman, practical\nengineer, mathematician, philosopher, flourished.  Without attempting\nto fix his date too closely, we may take it that he was a leading man\nin Miletus for the greater part of the {3} first half of the sixth\ncentury before Christ.  We hear of an eclipse predicted by him, of the\ncourse of a river usefully changed, of shrewd and profitable handling\nof the market, of wise advice in the general councils of the league.\nHe seems to have been at once a student of mathematics and an observer\nof nature, and withal something having analogy with both, an inquirer\nor speculator into the _origin_ of things.  To us nowadays this\nsuggests a student of geology, or physiography, or some such branch of\nphysical science; to Thales it probably rather suggested a theoretical\ninquiry into the simplest _thinkable_ aspect of things as existing.\n\"Under what form known to us,\" he would seem to have asked, \"may we\nassume an identity in all known things, so as best to cover or render\nexplicable the things as we know them?\"  The 'beginning' of things (for\nit was thus he described this assumed identity) was not conceived by\nhim as something which was long ages before, and which had ceased to\nbe; rather it meant the reality of things now.  Thales then was the\nputter of a question, which had not been asked expressly before, but\nwhich has never ceased to be asked since.  He was also the formulator\nof a new meaning for a word; the word 'beginning' ((Greek) _arche_) got\nthe meaning of 'underlying reality' and so of 'ending' as well.  In\nshort, he so dealt with a word, on the surface of it implying {4} time,\nas to eliminate the idea of time, and suggest a method of looking at\nthe world, more profound and far-reaching than had been before\nimagined.[1]\n\nIt is interesting to find that the man who was thus the first\nphilosopher, the first observer who took a metaphysical, non-temporal,\nanalytical view of the world, and so became the predecessor of all\nthose votaries of 'other-world' ways of thinking,--whether as academic\nidealist, or 'budge doctor of the Stoic fur,' or Christian ascetic or\nwhat not, whose ways are such a puzzle to the 'hard-headed practical\nman,'--was himself one of the shrewdest men of his day, so shrewd that\nby common consent he was placed foremost in antiquity among the Seven\nSages, or seven shrewd men, whose practical wisdom became a world's\ntradition, enshrined in anecdote and crystallised in proverb.\n\n[9]\n\nThe chief record that we possess of the philosophic teaching of Thales\nis contained in an interesting notice of earlier philosophies by\nAristotle, the main part of which as regards Thales runs as follows:\n\n\"The early philosophers as a rule formulated the originative principle\n((Greek) _arche_) of all things under some material expression.  By the\noriginative principle or element of things they meant that of which all\n{5} existing things are composed, that which determines their coming\ninto being, and into which they pass on ceasing to be.  Where these\nphilosophers differed from each other was simply in the answer which\nthey gave to the question what was the nature of this principle, the\ndifferences of view among them applying both to the number, and to the\ncharacter, of the supposed element or elements.\n\n\"Thales, the pioneer of this philosophy, maintained that _Water_ was\nthe originative principle of all things.  It was doubtless in this\nsense that he said that the earth rested on water.  What suggested the\nconception to him may have been such facts of observation, as that all\nforms of substance which promote life are moist, that heat itself seems\nto be conditioned by moisture, that the life-producing seed in all\ncreatures is moist, and so on.\"\n\nOther characteristics of water, it is elsewhere suggested, may have\nbeen in Thales' mind, such as its readiness to take various shapes, its\nconvertibility from water into vapour or ice, its ready mixture with\nother substances, and so forth.  What we have chiefly to note is, that\nthe more unscientific this theory about the universe may strike us as\nbeing, the more completely out of accord with facts now familiar to\neverybody, the more striking is it as marking a new mood of mind, in\nwhich _unity_, though only very partially suggested or discoverable by\nthe senses, is {6} preferred to that infinite and indefinite _variety_\nand _difference_ which the senses give us at every moment.  There is\nhere the germ of a new aspiration, of a determination not to rest in\nthe merely momentary and different, but at least to try, even against\nthe apparent evidence of the senses, for something more permanently\nintelligible.  As a first suggestion of what this permanent underlying\nreality may be, _Water_ might very well pass.  It is probable that even\nto Thales himself it was only a symbol, like the figure in a\nmathematical proposition, representing by the first passable physical\nphenomenon which came to hand, that ideal reality underlying all\nchange, which is at once the beginning, the middle, and the end of all.\nThat he did not mean Water, in the ordinary prosaic sense, to be\nidentical with this, is suggested by some [10] other sayings of his.\n\"Thales,\" says Aristotle elsewhere, \"thought the whole universe was\nfull of gods.\"  \"All things,\" he is recorded as saying, \"have a _soul_\nin them, in virtue of which they move other things, and are themselves\nmoved, even as the magnet, by virtue of its life or soul, moves the\niron.\"  Without pushing these fragmentary utterances too far, we may\nwell conclude that whether Thales spoke of the soul of the universe and\nits divine indwelling powers, or gods, or of water as the origin of\nthings, he was only vaguely symbolising in different ways an idea as\nyet formless and void, like the primeval chaos, but nevertheless, {7}\nlike it, containing within it a promise and a potency of greater life\nhereafter.\n\nII. ANAXIMANDER.--Our information with respect to thinkers so remote as\nthese men is too scanty and too fragmentary, to enable us to say in\nwhat manner or degree they influenced each other.  We cannot say for\ncertain that any one of them was pupil or antagonist of another.  They\nappear each of them, one might say for a moment only, from amidst the\ndarkness of antiquity; a few sayings of theirs we catch vaguely across\nthe void, and then they disappear.  There is not, consequently, any\nvery distinct progression or continuity observable among them, and so\nfar therefore one has to confess that the title 'School of Miletus' is\na misnomer.  We have already quoted the words of Aristotle in which he\nclasses the Ionic philosophers together, as all of them giving a\n_material_ aspect of some kind to the originative principle of the\nuniverse (see above, P. 4).  But while this is a characteristic\nobservable in some of them, it is not so obviously discoverable in the\nsecond of their number, Anaximander.\n\nThis philosopher is said to have been younger by [11] one generation\nthan Thales, but to have been intimate with him.  He, like Thales, was\na native of Miletus, and while we do not hear of him as a person, like\nThales, of political eminence and activity, he was certainly the equal,\nif not the superior, of Thales in {8} mathematical and scientific\nability.  He is said to have either invented or at least made known to\nGreece the construction of the sun-dial.  He was associated with\nHecataeus in the construction of the earliest geographical charts or\nmaps; he devoted himself with some success to the science of astronomy.\nHis familiarity with the abstractions of mathematics perhaps accounts\nfor the more abstract form, in which he expressed his idea of the\nprinciple of all things.\n\n[21]\n\nTo Anaximander this principle was, as he expressed it, the _infinite_;\nnot water nor any other of the so-called elements, but a different\nthing from any of them, something hardly namable, out of whose\nformlessness the heavens and all the worlds in them came to be.  And by\nnecessity into that same infinite or indefinite existence, out of which\nthey originally emerged, did every created thing return.  Thus, as he\npoetically expressed it, \"Time brought its revenges, and for the\nwrong-doing of existence all things paid the penalty of death.\"\n\nThe momentary resting-place of Thales on the confines of the familiar\nworld of things, in his formulation of Water as the principle of\nexistence, is thus immediately removed.  We get, as it were, to the\nearliest conception of things as we find it in Genesis; before the\nheavens were, or earth, or the waters under the earth, or light, or\nsun, or moon, or grass, or the beast of the field, when the \"earth was\nwithout form, and void, and darkness was upon the {9} face of the\ndeep.\"  Only, be it observed, that while in the primitive Biblical idea\nthis formless void precedes in _time_ an ordered universe, in\nAnaximander's conception this formless infinitude is always here, is in\nfact the only reality which ever is here, something without beginning\nor ending, underlying all, enwrapping all, governing all.\n\nTo modern criticism this may seem to be little better than verbiage,\nhaving, perhaps, some possibilities of poetic treatment, but certainly\nvery unsatisfactory if regarded as science.  But to this we have to\nreply that one is not called upon to regard it as science.  Behind\nscience, as much to-day when our knowledge of the details of phenomena\nis so enormously increased, as in the times when science had hardly\nbegun, there lies a world of mystery which we cannot pierce, and yet\nwhich we are compelled to assume.  No scientific treatise can begin\nwithout assuming Matter and Force as data, and however much we may have\nlearned about the relations of _forces_ and the affinities of _things_,\nMatter and Force as such remain very much the same dim infinities, that\nthe originative 'Infinite' was to Anaximander.\n\nIt is to be noted, however, that while modern science assumes\nnecessarily _two_ correlative data or originative principles,--Force,\nnamely, as well as Matter,--Anaximander seems to have been content {10}\nwith the formulation of but one; and perhaps it is just here that a\nkinship still remains between him and Thales and other philosophers of\nthe school.  He, no more than they, seems to have definitely raised the\nquestion, How are we to account for, or formulate, the principle of\n_difference_ or change?  What is it that causes things to come into\nbeing out of, or recalls them back from being into, the infinite void?\nIt is to be confessed, however, that our accounts on this point are\nsomewhat conflicting.  One authority actually says that he formulated\nmotion as eternal also.  So far as he attempted to grasp the idea of\ndifference in relation to that of unity, he seems to have regarded the\nprinciple of change or difference as inhering in [13] the infinite\nitself.  Aristotle in this connection contrasts his doctrine with that\nof Anaxagoras, who formulated _two_ principles of existence--Matter and\nMind (see below, p. 54).  Anaximander, he points out, found all he\nwanted in the one.\n\nAs a mathematician Anaximander must have been familiar in various\naspects with the functions of the Infinite or Indefinable in the\norganisation of thought.  To the student of Euclid, for example, the\nimpossibility of adequately defining any of the fundamental elements of\nthe science of geometry--the point, the line, the surface--is a\nfamiliar fact.  In so far as a science of geometry is possible at all,\nthe exactness, which is its essential characteristic, is only {11}\nattainable by starting from data which are in themselves impossible, as\nof a point which has no magnitude, of a line which has no breadth, of a\nsurface which has no thickness.  So in the science of abstract number\nthe fundamental assumptions, as that 1=1, _x=x_, etc., are contradicted\nby every fact of experience, for in the world as we know it, absolute\nequality is simply impossible to discover; and yet these fundamental\nconceptions are in their development most powerful instruments for the\nextension of man's command over his own experiences.  Their\ncompleteness of abstraction from the accidents of experience, from the\ndifferences, qualifications, variations which contribute so largely to\nthe personal interests of life, this it is which makes the abstract\nsciences demonstrative, exact, and universally applicable.  In so far,\ntherefore, as we are permitted to grasp the conception of a perfectly\nabstract existence prior to, and underlying, and enclosing, all\nseparate existences, so far also do we get to a conception which is\ndemonstrative, exact, and universally applicable throughout the whole\nworld of knowable objects.\n\nSuch a conception, however, by its absolute emptiness of content, does\nnot afford any means in itself of progression; somehow and somewhere a\nprinciple of movement, of development, of concrete reality, must be\nfound or assumed, to link this ultimate abstraction of existence to the\nmultifarious phenomena {12} of existence as known.  And it was,\nperhaps, because Anaximander failed to work out this aspect of the\nquestion, that in the subsequent leaders of the school _movement_,\nrather than mere existence, was the principle chiefly insisted upon.\n\nBefore passing, however, to these successors of Anaximander, some\nopinions of his which we have not perhaps the means of satisfactorily\ncorrelating with his general conception, but which are not without\ntheir individual interest, may here be noted.  [14] The word _husk_ or\n_bark_ ((Greek) _phloios_) seems to have been a favourite one with him,\nas implying and depicting a conception of interior and necessary\ndevelopment in things.  Thus he seems to have postulated an inherent\ntendency or law in the infinite, which compelled it to develop contrary\ncharacters, as hot and cold, dry and moist.  In consequence of this\nfundamental tendency an envelope of fire, he says, came into being,\nencircling another envelope of air, which latter in turn enveloped the\nsphere of earth, each being like the 'husk' of the other, or like the\nbark which encloses the tree.  This concentric system he conceives as\nhaving in some way been parted up into various systems, represented by\nthe sun, the moon, the stars, and the earth.  The last he figured as\nhanging in space, and deriving its stability from the inherent and\nperfect balance or relation of its parts.\n\n{13}\n\n[16]\n\nThen, again, as to the origin of man, he seems to have in like manner\ntaught a theory of development from lower forms of life.  In his view\nthe first living creatures must have come into being in moisture (thus\nrecalling the theory of Thales).  As time went on, and these forms of\nlife reached their fuller possibilities, they came to be transferred to\nthe dry land, casting off their old nature like a husk or bark.  More\nparticularly he insists that man must have developed out of other and\nlower forms of life, because of his exceptional need, under present\nconditions, of care and nursing in his earlier years.  Had he come into\nbeing at once as a human creature he could never have survived.\n\nThe analogies of these theories with modern speculations are obvious\nand interesting.  But without enlarging on these, one has only to say\nin conclusion that, suggestive and interesting as many of these poor\nfragments, these _disjecti membra poetae_, are individually, they leave\nus more and more impressed with a sense of incompleteness in our\nknowledge of Anaximander's theory as a whole.  It may be that as a\nconsistent and perfected system the theory never was worked out; it may\nbe that it never was properly understood.\n\n\n\n[1] By some authorities it is stated that Anaximander, the second\nphilosopher of this school, was the first to use the word _arche_ in\nthe philosophic sense.  Whether this be so or not, Thales certainly had\nthe idea.\n\n\n\n\n{14}\n"]
