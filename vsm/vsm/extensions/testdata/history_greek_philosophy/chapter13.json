["CHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE INCOMPLETE SOCRATICS\n\n_A philosopher at ease--The sensual sty--Citizens of the world--The tub\nof Diogenes--A philosophy of abstracts_\n\n\n[204]\n\nI. ARISTIPPUS AND THE CYRENAICS.--Aristippus was a native of Cyrene, a\nGreek colony on the north coast of Africa.  He is said to have come to\nAthens because of his desire to hear Socrates; but from the notices of\nhim which we find in Xenophon's memoirs he appears to have been from\nthe first a somewhat intractable follower, dissenting especially from\nthe poverty and self-denial of the master's mode of life.  [205] He in\ncourse of time founded a school of his own, called the Cyrenaic from\nhis own place of birth, and from the fact that many subsequent leaders\nof the school also belonged to Cyrene.  Among his notable disciples\nwere his daughter Arete, her son named Aristippus after his\ngrandfather, Ptolemaeus the Aethiopian, Antipater of Cyrene, and a long\nsuccession of others.\n\nAristippus was a man of considerable subtlety of mind, a ready speaker,\nclever in adapting himself to persons and circumstances.  On one\noccasion, being {125} asked what benefit he considered philosophy had\nconferred upon him, he answered, \"The capacity of associating with\nevery one without embarrassment.\"  Philosophy, in fact, was to\nAristippus a method of social culture, a means of making the best of\nlife as he found it.  As Horace observes of him (_Epp_. i. 17. 23)--\n\n  Omnis Aristippum decuit color et status et res\n  Tentantem majora, fere praesentibus aequum.\n\n\"Every aspect and manner of life and fortune fitted Aristippus; he\naimed at what was greater, yet kept an even, mind whatever his present\ncondition.\"\n\n[206]\n\nAs we have already said, this school was _incompletely_ Socratic,\ninasmuch as philosophy was not an end in itself, knowledge whether of\noneself or of other matters had no intrinsic interest for them;\nphilosophy was only a means towards pleasurable living, enabling them\nso to analyse and classify the several experiences of life as to render\na theory of satisfactory [207] existence possible.  With them first\ncame into prominence a phrase which held a large place in all\nsubsequent Greek philosophy, the _End_ of existence, by which was meant\nthat which summed up the good in existence, that which made life worth\nliving, that which was good and desirable in and for itself, and not\nmerely as a means to something else.  What then according to the\nCyrenaics was the End of life?  {126} Their answer was that life had at\neach moment its own End, in the pleasure of that moment.  The past was\ngone, the future not yet with us; remembrance of the one, fear or hope\nof the other, might contribute to affect the purity of the present\npleasure, but such as it was the present pleasure was a thing apart,\ncomplete in and for itself.  Nor was its perfection qualified by any\nquestion of the means by which it was procured; the moment's pleasure\nwas pleasurable, whatever men might say as to the manner of its [208]\nprocuring.  This pleasure was a tranquil activity of the being, like\nthe gently heaving sea, midway between violent motion which was pain,\nand absolute calm which was insensibility.  As a state of activity it\nwas something positive, not a mere release from [209] pain, not a\nsimple filling up of a vacuum.  Nothing was in its essential nature\neither just or noble or base; custom and convention pronounced them one\nor other.  The wise man made the best he could of his conditions;\nvaluing mental activity and friendship and wealth and bodily exercise,\nand avoiding envy and excessive indulgence of passion and superstition,\nnot because the first were in themselves good or the second evil, but\nbecause they were respectively helpers or hinderers of pleasure.  He is\nthe master and possessor of pleasure not who abstains from it, but who\nuses it and keeps his self-command in the using.  Moderate\nindulgence--this is wisdom.\n\n{127}\n\n[210]\n\nThe one criterion, whether of good or of truth, is the feeling of the\nmoment for the man who feels it; all question of causes of feelings is\ndelusive.  We can say with truth and certainty, I have the sensation of\nwhite or the sensation of sweet.  But that there is a white or a sweet\nthing which is the cause of the sensation, that we cannot say for\ncertain.  A man may very well have the sensation white or sweet from\nsomething which has no such quality, as men in delusion or madness have\nimpressions that are true and real inasmuch as they have them, although\nother people do not admit their reality.  There is, therefore, no\ncriterion of truth as between man and man; we may employ the same\nwords, but each has his own impressions and his own individual\nexperiences.\n\nOne can easily understand this as the doctrine of such a man as\nAristippus, the easy-going man of the world, the courtier and the wit,\nthe favourite of the tyrant Dionysius; it fits in well enough with a\nlife of genial self-indulgence; it always reappears whenever a man has\nreconciled himself 'to roll with pleasure in a sensual sty.'  But life\nis not always, nor for most persons at any time, a thing of ease and\nsoft enchantments, and the Cyrenaic philosophy must remain for the\ngeneral work-a-day world a stale exotic.  'Every man for himself and\nthe devil take the hindmost,' is a maxim which comes as a rule {128}\nonly to the lips of the worldly successful, while they think themselves\nstrong enough to stand alone.  But this solitude of selfishness neither\nworks nor lasts; every man at some time becomes 'the hindmost,' if not\nbefore, at least in the hour of death for him or his; at that hour he\nis hardly disposed, for himself or those he loves, to repeat his maxim.\n\nII. ANTISTHENES AND THE CYNICS.--Aristippus, in his praises of pleasure\nas the one good for man (see above, p. 126), remarks that there were\nsome who [209] refused pleasure \"from perversity of mind,\" taking\npleasure, so to speak, in the denial of pleasure.  The school of the\nCynics made this perverse mood, as Aristippus deemed it, the maxim of\ntheir philosophy.  As the Cyrenaic school was the school of the rich,\nthe courtly, the self-indulgent, so the Cynic was the school of the\npoor, the exiles, the ascetics.  Each was an extreme expression of a\nphase of Greek life and thought, though there was this point of union\n[215] between them, that _liberty_ of a kind was sought by both.  The\nCyrenaics claimed liberty to please themselves in the choice of their\nenjoyments; the Cynics sought liberty through denial of enjoyments.\n[219] Both, moreover, were cosmopolitan; they mark the decay of the\nGreek patriotism, which was essentially civic, and the rise of the\nwider but less intense conception of humanity.  Aristippus, in a\nconversation with Socrates (Xenoph. _Memor_. II. i.) on the {129}\nqualifications of those who are fitted to be magistrates, disclaims all\ndesire to hold such a position himself.  \"There is,\" he says, \"to my\nthinking, a middle way, neither of rule nor of slavery, but of freedom,\nwhich leads most surely to true happiness.  So to avoid all the evils\nof partisanship and faction I nowhere take upon me the position of a\ncitizen, but in every city remain a sojourner and a stranger.\"  And in\nlike manner Antisthenes the Cynic, being asked how a man should\napproach politics, answered, \"He will approach it as he will fire, not\ntoo near, lest he be burnt; not too far away, lest he starve of cold.\"\nAnd Diogenes, being asked of what city he was, answered, \"I am a\ncitizen of the world.\"  The Cynic ideal, in fact, was summed up in\nthese four words--wisdom, independence, free speech, liberty.\n\n[214]\n\nAntisthenes, founder of the school, was a native of Athens, but being\nof mixed blood (his mother was a Thracian) he was not recognised as an\nAthenian citizen.  He was a student first under Gorgias, and acquired\nfrom him a considerable elegance of literary style; subsequently he\nbecame a devoted hearer of Socrates, and became prominent among his\nfollowers for an asceticism surpassing his master's.  One day, we are\ntold, he showed a great rent in the thread-bare cloak which was his\nonly garment, whereupon Socrates slily remarked, \"I can see through\nyour cloak your love of glory.\"  He carried a leathern {130} scrip and\na staff, and the 'scrip and staff' became distinctive marks of his\nschool.  The name Cynic, derived from the Greek word for a dog, is\nvariously accounted for, some attributing it to the 'doglike' habits of\nthe school, others to their love of 'barking' criticism, others to the\nfact that a certain gymnasium in the outskirts of Athens, called\nCynosarges, sacred to Hercules the patron-divinity of men in the\npolitical position of Antisthenes, was a favourite resort of his.  He\nwas a voluminous, some thought a too voluminous, [216] expounder of his\ntenets.  Like the other Incomplete Socratics, his teaching was mainly\non ethical questions.\n\n[215]\n\nHis chief pupil and successor was the famous Diogenes, a native of\nSinope, a Greek colony on the Euxine Sea.  He even bettered the\ninstructions of his master in the matter of extreme frugality of\nliving, claiming that he was a true follower of Hercules in preferring\nindependence to every other good.  The tale of his living in a cask or\ntub is well known.  His theory was that the peculiar privilege of the\ngods consisted in their need of nothing; men approached nearest the\nlife of the gods in needing as little as possible.\n\n[217]\n\nMany other sayings of one or other teacher are quoted, all tending to\nthe same conclusion.  For example, \"I had rather be mad than enjoying\nmyself!\"  \"Follow the pleasures that come after pains, not those which\nbring pains in their train.\"  \"There {131} are pains that are useless,\nthere are pains that are natural: the wise choose the latter, and thus\nfind happiness even through pain.  For the very contempt of pleasure\ncomes with practice to be the highest pleasure.\"  \"When I wish a\ntreat,\" says Antisthenes, \"I do not go and buy it at great cost in the\nmarketplace; I find my storehouse of pleasures in the soul.\"\n\n[218]\n\nThe life of the wise man, therefore, was a training of mind and body to\ndespise pleasure and attain independence.  In this way virtue was\nteachable, and could be so acquired as to become an inseparable\npossession.  The man who had thus attained to wisdom, not of words, but\nof deeds, was, as it were, in an impregnable fortress that could\nneither crumble into ruin nor be lost by treachery.  And so\nAntisthenes, being asked what was the most essential point of learning,\nanswered, \"To unlearn what is evil.\"  That is to say, to the Cynic\nconception, men were born with a root of evil in them in the love of\npleasure; the path of wisdom was a weaning of soul and body by practice\nfrom the allurements of pleasure, until both were so perfectly\naccustomed to its denial as to find an unalloyed pleasure in the very\nact of [219] refusing it.  In this way virtue became absolutely\nsufficient for happiness, and so far was it from being necessary to\nhave wealth or the admiration of men in addition, that the true kingly\nlife was \"to do well, {132} and be ill spoken of.\"  All else but virtue\nwas a matter of indifference.\n\nThe cosmopolitan temper of these men led them to hold of small account\nthe forms and prejudices of ordinary society: they despised the rites\nof marriage; they thought no flesh unclean.  They believed in no\nmultifarious theology; there was but one divinity--the power that ruled\nall nature, the one absolutely self-centred independent being, whose\nmanner of [221] existence they sought to imitate.  Nor had they any\nsympathy with the subtleties of verbal distinction cultivated by some\nof the Socratics, as by other philosophers or Sophists of their time.\nDefinitions and abstractions and classifications led to no good.  A man\nwas a man; what was good was good; to say that a man was good did not\nestablish the existence of some abstract class of goods.  As\nAntisthenes once said to Plato, \"A horse I see, but 'horseness' I do\nnot see.\"  What the exact point of this criticism was we may reserve\nfor the present.\n\n[222]\n\nIII. EUCLIDES THE MEGARIC.--Euclides, a native of Megara on the\nCorinthian isthmus, was a devoted hearer of Socrates, making his way to\nhear him, sometimes even at the 'risk of his life, in defiance of a\ndecree of his native city forbidding intercourse with Athens.  When\nPlato and other Athenian followers of Socrates thought well to quit\nAthens for {133} a time after Socrates' execution, they were kindly\nentertained by Euclides at Megara.\n\nThe exact character of the development which the Socratic teaching\nreceived from Euclides and his school is a matter of considerable\ndoubt.  The allusions to the tenets of the school in Plato and [223]\nothers are only fragmentary.  We gather, however, from them that\nEuclides was wholly antithetical to the personal turn given to\nphilosophy, both by the Cyrenaics and the Cynics.  He revived and\ndeveloped with much dialectical subtlety the metaphysical system of\nParmenides and the Eleatics, maintaining that there is but one absolute\nexistence, and that sense and sense-perceptions as against this [224]\nare nothing.  This one absolute existence was alone absolutely good,\nand the good for man could only be found in such an absorption of\nhimself in this one absolute good through reason and contemplation, as\nwould bring his spirit into perfectness of union with it.  Such\nabsorption raised a man above the troubles and pains of life, and thus,\nin insensibility to these through reason, man attained his highest good.\n\nThe school is perhaps interesting only in so far as it marks the\ncontinued survival of the abstract dialectic method of earlier\nphilosophy.  As such it had a very definite influence, sometimes\nthrough agreement, sometimes by controversy, on the systems of Plato\nand Aristotle now to be dealt with.\n\n\n\n\n{134}\n"]
