["CHAPTER II\n\nTHE SCHOOL OF MILETUS (_concluded_)\n\n_Air the beginning of things--All things pass--The eternal and the\ntemporary--The weeping philosopher_\n\n\n[17]\n\nIII. ANAXIMENES.--This philosopher was also a native of Miletus, and is\nsaid to have been a hearer or pupil of Anaximander.  As we have said,\nthe [19] tendency of the later members of the school was towards\nemphasising the _motive_ side of the supposed underlying principle of\nnature, and accordingly Anaximenes chose Air as the element which best\n[18] represented or symbolised that principle.  Its fluidity, readiness\nof movement, wide extension, and absolute neutrality of character as\nregards colour, taste, smell, form, etc., were obvious suggestions.\nThe breath also, whose very name to the ancients implied an identity\nwith the life or soul, was nothing but air; and the identification of\nAir with Life supplied just that principle of productiveness and\nmovement, which was felt [20] to be necessary in the primal element of\nbeing.  The process of existence, then, he conceived as consisting in a\ncertain concentration of this diffused life-giving element into more or\nless solidified forms, and the {15} ultimate separation and expansion\nof these back into the formless air again.  The contrary forces\npreviously used by Anaximander--heat and cold, drought and\nmoisture--are with Anaximenes also the agencies which institute these\nchanges.\n\nThis is pretty nearly all that we know of Anaximenes.  So far as the\nfew known facts reveal him, we can hardly say that except as supplying\na step towards the completer development of the _motive_ [22] idea in\nbeing, he greatly adds to the chain of progressive thought.\n\nIV. HERACLITUS.--Although not a native of Miletus, but of Ephesus,\nHeraclitus, both by his nationality as an Ionian and by his position in\nthe development of philosophic conceptions, falls naturally to be\nclassed with the philosophers of Miletus.  His period may be given\napproximately as from about 560 to 500 B.C., though others place him a\ngeneration later.  Few authentic particulars have been preserved of\nhim.  We hear of extensive travels, of his return to his native city\nonly to refuse a share in its activities, of his retirement to a\nhermit's life.  He seems to have formed a contrast to the preceding\nphilosophers in his greater detachment from the ordinary interests of\ncivic existence; and much in his teaching suggests the ascetic if not\nthe misanthrope.  He received the nickname of 'The Obscure,' from the\nstudied mystery in which he was supposed to involve his {16} [23]\nteaching.  He wrote not for the vulgar, but for the gifted few.  'Much\nlearning makes not wise' was the motto of his work; the man of gift, of\ninsight, that man is better than ten thousand.  He was savage in his\ncriticism of other writers, even the greatest.  Homer, he said, and\nArchilochus too, deserved to be hooted from the platform and thrashed.\nEven the main purport of his writings was differently interpreted.\nSome named his work 'The Muses,' as though it were chiefly a poetic\nvision; others named it 'The sure Steersman to the Goal of Life';\nothers, more prosaically, 'A Treatise of Nature.'\n\n[26]\n\nThe fundamental principle or fact of being Heraclitus formulated in the\nfamous dictum, 'All things pass.'  In the eternal flux or flow of being\nconsisted its reality; even as in a river the water is ever changing,\nand the river exists as a river only in virtue of this continual\nchange; or as in a living body, wherein while there is life there is no\nstability or fixedness; stability and fixedness are the attributes of\nthe unreal image of life, not of life itself.  Thus, as will be\nobserved, from the _material_ basis of being as conceived by Thales,\nwith only a very vague conception of the counter-principle of movement,\nphilosophy has wheeled round in Heraclitus to the other extreme; he\nfinds his permanent element in the negation of permanence; being or\nreality consists in never 'being' but always 'becoming,' not in\nstability but in change.\n\n{17}\n\n[27]\n\nThis eternal movement he pictures elsewhere as an eternal strife of\nopposites, whose differences nevertheless consummate themselves in\nfinest harmony.  Thus oneness emerges out of multiplicity, multiplicity\nout of oneness; and the harmony of the universe is of contraries, as of\nthe lyre and the bow.  _War_ is the father and king and lord of all\nthings.  Neither god nor man presided at the creation of anything that\nis; that which was, is that which is, and that which ever shall be;\neven an ever-living Fire, ever kindling and ever being extinguished.\n\n[28]\n\nThus in _Fire_, as an image or symbol of the underlying reality of\nexistence, Heraclitus advanced to the furthest limit attainable on\nphysical lines, for the expression of its essentially _motive_\ncharacter.  That this Fire was no more than a symbol, suggested by the\nspecial characteristics of fire in nature,--its subtlety, its mobility,\nits power of penetrating all things and devouring all things, its\npowers for beneficence in the warmth of living bodies and the\nlife-giving power of the sun,--is seen in the fact that he readily\nvaries his expression for this principle, calling it at times the\nThunderbolt, at others the eternal Reason, [29] or Law, or Fate.  To\nhis mental view creation was a process eternally in action, the fiery\nelement descending by the law of its being into the cruder [30] forms\nof water and earth, only to be resolved again by upward process into\nfire; even as one sees the {18} vapour from the sea ascending and\nmelting into the [32] aether.  As a kindred vapour or exhalation he\nrecognised the Soul or Breath for a manifestation of the essential\nelement.  It is formless, ever changing with every breath we take, yet\nit is the constructive and unifying force which keeps the body\ntogether, and conditions its life and growth.  At this point [33]\nHeraclitus comes into touch with Anaximenes.  In the act of breathing\nwe draw into our own being a portion of the all-pervading vital element\nof all being; in this universal being we thereby live and move and have\nour consciousness; the eternal and omnipresent wisdom becomes, through\nthe channels of our senses, and especially through the eyes, in\nfragments at least our wisdom.  In sleep we are not indeed cut off\nwholly from this wisdom; through our breathing we hold as it were to\nits root; but of its flower we are then deprived.  On awaking again we\nbegin once more to partake according to our full measure of the living\nthought; even as coals when brought near the fire are themselves made\npartakers of it, but when taken away again become quenched.\n\n[34]\n\nHence, in so far as man is wise, it is because his spirit is kindled by\nunion with the universal spirit; but there is a baser, or, as\nHeraclitus termed it, a moister element also in him, which is the\nelement of unreason, as in a drunken man.  And thus the trustworthiness\nor otherwise of the senses, as the {19} channels of communication with\nthe divine, depends on the _dryness_ or _moistness_,--or, as we should\nexpress it, using, after all, only another metaphor,--on the\n_elevation_ or _baseness_ of the spirit that is within.  To those whose\nsouls are base and barbarous, the eternal movement, the living fire, is\ninvisible; and thus what they do see is nothing but death.  Immersed in\nthe mere appearances of things and their supposed stability, they,\nwhether sleeping or waking, behold only dead forms; their spirits are\ndead.\n\n[35]\n\nFor the guidance of life there is no law but the common sense, which is\nthe union of those fragmentary perceptions of eternal law, which\nindividual men [37] attain, in so far as their spirits are dry and\npure.  Of absolute knowledge human nature is not capable, but only the\nDivine.  To the Eternal, therefore, alone all things are good and\nbeautiful and just, because to Him alone do things appear in their\ntotality.  To the human partial reason some things are unjust and\nothers just.  Hence life, by reason of the limitations [38] involved in\nit, he sometimes spoke of as the death of the soul, and death as the\nrenewal of its life.  And so, [39] in the great events of man's life\nand in the small, as in the mighty circle of the heavens, good and\nevil, life and death, growth and decay, are but the systole and\ndiastole, the outward and inward pulsation, of an eternal good, an\neternal harmony.  Day and {20} night, winter and summer, war and peace,\nsatiety and hunger--each conditions the other, all are part of God.  It\nis sickness that makes health good and sweet, hunger that gives its\npleasure to feeding, weariness that makes sleep a good.\n\n[39]\n\nThis vision of existence in its eternal flux and interchange, seems to\nhave inspired Heraclitus with a contemplative melancholy.  In the\ntraditions of later times he was known as the _weeping_ philosopher.\nLucian represents him as saying, \"To me it is a sorrow that there is\nnothing fixed or secure, and that all things are thrown confusedly\ntogether, so that pleasure and pain, knowledge and ignorance, the great\nand the small, are the same, ever circling round and passing one into\nthe other in the sport of time.\"  \"Time,\" he says elsewhere, \"is like a\nchild that plays with the dice.\"  The highest good, therefore, for\nmortals is that clarity of perception in respect of oneself and all\nthat is, whereby we shall learn to apprehend somewhat of the eternal\nunity and harmony, that underlies the good and evil of time, the shock\nand stress of circumstance and place.  The highest virtue for man is a\nplacid and a quiet constancy, whatever the changes and chances of life\nmay bring.  It is the pantheistic apathy.\n\nThe sadder note of humanity, the note of Euripides and at times of\nSophocles, the note of Dante and of the _Tempest_ of Shakespeare, of\nShelley and Arnold {21} and Carlyle,--this note we hear thus early and\nthus clear, in the dim and distant utterances of Heraclitus.  The\nmystery of existence, the unreality of what seems most real, the\nintangibility and evanescence of all things earthly,--these thoughts\nobscurely echoing to us across the ages from Heraclitus, have remained,\nand always will remain, among the deepest and most insistent of the\nworld's thoughts, in its sincerest moments and in its greatest thinkers.\n\n\n\n\n{22}\n"]
