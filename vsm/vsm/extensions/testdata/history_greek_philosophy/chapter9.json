["CHAPTER IX\n\nTHE SOPHISTS\n\n_Anarchic philosophy--Success not truth--Man the measure--All opinions\ntrue--Reductio ad absurdum_\n\n\nA certain analogy may perhaps be discerned between the progression of\nphilosophic thought in Greece as we have traced it, and the political\ndevelopment which had its course in almost every Greek state during the\nsame period.  The Ionic philosophy may be regarded as corresponding\nwith the _kingly_ era in Greek politics.  Philosophy sits upon the\nheights and utters its authoritative dicta for the resolution of the\nseeming contradictions of things.  One principle is master, but the\ntestimony of the senses is not denied; a harmony of thought and\nsensation is sought in the interpretation of appearances by the light\nof a ruling idea.  In Pythagoras and his order we have an\n_aristocratic_ organisation of philosophy.  Its truths are for the few,\nthe best men are the teachers, equal as initiated partakers in the\nmysteries, supreme over all outside their society.  A reasoned and\nreasonable order and method are {83} symbolised by their theory of\nNumber; their philosophy is political, their politics oligarchic.  In\nthe Eleatic school we have a succession of personal attempts to\nconstruct a _domination_ in the theory of Nature; some ideal conception\nis attempted to be so elevated above the data of sensation as to\noverride them altogether, and the general result we are now to see\nthroughout the philosophic world, as it was seen also throughout the\nworld of politics, in a total collapse of the principle of forced\nauthority, and a development, of successively nearer approaches to\nanarchic individualism and doubt.  The notion of an ultimately true and\nreal, whatever form it might assume in various theorists' hands, being\nin its essence apart from and even antagonistic to the perceptions of\nsense, was at last definitely cast aside as a delusion; what remained\nwere the individual perceptions, admittedly separate, unreasoned,\nunrelated; Reason was dethroned, Chaos was king.  In other words, what\n_seemed_ to any individual sentient being at any moment to be, that for\nhim was, and nothing else was.  The distinction between the real and\nthe apparent was definitely attempted to be abolished, not as hitherto\nby rejecting the sensually apparent in favour of the rationally\nconceived real, but by the denial of any such real altogether.\n\nThe individualistic revolution in philosophy not {84} only, however,\nhad analogies with the similar revolution contemporaneously going on in\nGreek politics, it was greatly facilitated by it.  Each, in short,\nacted and reacted on the other.  Just as the sceptical philosophy of\nthe Encyclopaedists in France promoted the Revolution, and the\nRevolution in its turn developed and confirmed the philosophic\nscepticism, so also the collapse of contending philosophies in Greece\npromoted the collapse of contending systems of political authority, and\nthe collapse of political authority facilitated the growth of that\nindividualism in thought with which the name of the Sophists is\nassociated.\n\n[178]\n\nCicero (_Brut_. 12) definitely connects the rise of these teachers with\nthe expulsion of the tyrants and the establishment of democratic\nrepublics in Sicily.  From 466 to 406 B.C. Syracuse was democratically\ngoverned, and a 'free career to talents,' as in revolutionary France,\nso also in revolutionary Greece, began to be promoted by the\nelaboration of a system of persuasive argument.  Devices of method\ncalled 'commonplaces' were constructed, whereby, irrespective of the\ntruth or falsehood of the subject-matter, a favourable vote in the\npublic assemblies, a successful verdict in the public courts, might\nmore readily be procured.  Thus by skill of verbal rhetoric, the worse\nmight be made to appear the better reason; and philosophy, so far as it\ncontinued its functions, {85} became a search, not for the real amidst\nthe confusions of the seeming and unreal, but a search for the seeming\nand the plausible, to the detriment, or at least to the ignoring, of\nany reality at all.\n\nThe end of philosophy then was no longer universal truth, but\nindividual success; and consistently enough, the philosopher himself\nprofessed the individualism of his own point of view, by teaching only\nthose who were prepared to pay him for his teaching.  All over Greece,\nwith the growth of democracy, this philosophy of persuasion became\npopular; but it was to Athens, under Pericles at this time the centre\nof all that was most vivid and splendid in Greek life and thought, that\nthe chief teachers of the new philosophy flocked from every part of the\nGreek world.\n\n[177]\n\nThe first great leader of the Sophists was _Protagoras_.  He, it is\nsaid, was the first to teach for pay; he also was the first to adopt\nthe name of Sophist.  In the word Sophist there was indeed latent the\nidea which subsequently attached to it, but as first used it seems to\nhave implied this only, that _skill_ was the object of the teaching\nrather than _truth_; the new teachers professed themselves 'practical\nmen,' not mere theorists.\n\nThe Greek word, in short, meant an able cultivated man in any branch of\nthe arts; and the development of practical capacity was doubtless what\nProtagoras {86} intended to indicate as the purpose of his teaching,\nwhen he called himself a Sophist.  But the ability he really undertook\nto cultivate was ability to _persuade_, for Greece at this time was\nnothing if not political; and persuasive oratory was the one road to\npolitical success.  And as Athens was the great centre of Greek\npolitics, as well as of Greek intellect, to Athens Protagoras came as a\nteacher.\n\nHe was born at Abdera, in Thrace (birthplace also of Democritus), in\n480 B.C., began to teach at Athens about 451 B.C., and soon acquired\ngreat influence with Pericles, the distinguished leader of the Athenian\ndemocracy at this time.  It is even alleged that when in 445 the\nAthenians were preparing to establish a colony at Thurii in Italy,\nProtagoras was requested to draw up a code of laws for the new state,\nand personally to superintend its execution.\n\nAfter spending some time in Italy he returned to Athens, and taught\nthere with great success for a number of years.  Afterwards he taught\nfor some time in Sicily, and died at the age of seventy, after [178]\nabout forty years of professional activity.  He does not seem to have\ncontented himself with the merely practical task of teaching rhetoric,\nbut in a work which he, perhaps ironically, entitled _Truth_, he\nenunciated the principles on which he based his teaching.  Those\nprinciples were summed up in the sentence, \"Man (by which he meant\n_each_ man) is {87} the measure of all things, whether of their\nexistence when they do exist, or of their non-existence when [179] they\ndo not.\"  In the development of this doctrine Protagoras starts from a\nsomewhat similar analysis of things to that of Heraclitus and others.\nEverything is in continual flux, and the apparently real objects in\nnature are the mere temporary and illusory result of the in themselves\ninvisible movements and minglings of the elements of which they are\ncomposed; and not only is it a delusion to attempt to give a factitious\nreality to the things which appear, it is equally a delusion to attempt\nto separate the (supposed) thing perceived from the perception itself.\nA thing is only as and when it is perceived.  And a third delusion is\nto attempt to separate a supposed perceiving mind from the perception;\nall three exist only in and through the momentary perception; the\nsupposed reality behind this, whether external in the object or\ninternal in the mind, is a mere imagination.  Thus the Heraclitean flux\nin Nature was extended to Mind also; only the sensation exists, and\nthat only at the moment of its occurrence; this alone is truth, this\nalone is reality; all else is delusion.\n\n[180]\n\nIt followed from this that as a man felt a thing to be, so for him it\nveritably was.  Thus abstract truth or falsity could not be; the same\nstatements could be indifferently true or false--to different {88}\nindividuals at the same time, to the same individual at different\ntimes.  It followed that all appearances were equally true: what seemed\nto be to any man, that was alone the true for him.  The relation of\nsuch a doctrine as this to politics and to morals is not far to seek.\nEvery man's opinion was as good as another's; if by persuasion you\nsucceeded in altering a man's opinion, you had not deceived the man,\nhis new opinion was as true (to him) as the old one.  Persuasiveness,\ntherefore, was the only wisdom.  Thus if a man is ill what he eats and\ndrinks seems bitter to him, and it is so; when he is well it seems the\nopposite, and is so.  He is not a wiser man in the second state than in\nthe first, but the second state is pleasanter.  If then you can\npersuade him that what he thinks bitter is really sweet, you have done\nhim good.  This is what the physician tries to do by his drugs; this is\nwhat the Sophist tries to do by his words.  Virtue then is teachable in\nso far as it is possible to persuade a boy or a man by rhetoric that\nthat course of conduct which pleases others is a pleasant course for\nhim.  But if any one happens not to be persuaded of this, and continues\nto prefer his own particular course of conduct, this _is_ for him the\ngood course.  You cannot blame him; you cannot say he is wrong.  If you\npunish him you simply endeavour to supply the dose of unpleasantness\nwhich may {89} be needed to put the balance in his case on the same\nside as it already occupies in the case of other people.\n\nIt may be worth while to anticipate a little, and insert here in\nsummary the refutation of this position put into the mouth of Socrates\nby Plato in the _Theaetetus_: \"But I ought not to conceal from you that\nthere is a serious objection which may be urged against this doctrine\nof Protagoras.  For there are states, such as madness and dreaming, in\nwhich perception is false; and half our life is spent in dreaming; and\nwho can say that at this instant we are not dreaming?  Even the fancies\nof madmen are real at the time.  But if knowledge is perception, how\ncan we distinguish between the true and the false in such cases? . . .\nShall I tell you what amazes me in your friend Protagoras?  'What may\nthat be?'  I like his doctrine that what appears is; but I wonder that\nhe did not begin his great work on truth with a declaration that a pig,\nor a dog-faced baboon, or any other monster which has sensation, is a\nmeasure of all things; then while we were reverencing him as a god he\nmight have produced a magnificent effect by expounding to us that he\nwas no wiser than a tadpole.  For if truth is only sensation, and one\nman's discernment is as good as another's, and every man is his own\njudge, and everything that he judges is right and true, then {90} what\nneed of Protagoras to be our instructor at a high figure; and why\nshould we be less knowing than he is, or have to go to him, if every\nman is the measure of all things?\" . . .  Socrates now resumes the\nargument.  As he is very desirous of doing justice to Protagoras, he\ninsists on citing his own words: 'What appears to each man is to him.'\n\"And how,\" asks Socrates, \"are these words reconcilable with the fact\nthat all mankind are agreed in thinking themselves wiser than others in\nsome respects, and inferior to them in others?  In the hour of danger\nthey are ready to fall down and worship any one who is their superior\nin wisdom as if he were a god.  And the world is full of men who are\nasking to be taught and willing to be ruled, and of other men who are\nwilling to rule and teach them.  All which implies that men do judge of\none another's impressions, and think some wise and others foolish.  How\nwill Protagoras answer this argument?  For he cannot say that no one\ndeems another ignorant or mistaken.  If you form a judgment, thousands\nand tens of thousands are ready to maintain the opposite.  The\nmultitude may not and do not agree in Protagoras' own thesis, 'that man\nis the measure of all things,' and then who is to decide?  Upon hip own\nshowing must not his 'truth' depend on the number of suffrages, and be\nmore or less true in proportion as he has more or fewer of them?  And\n{91} [the majority being against him] he will be bound to acknowledge\nthat they speak truly who deny him to speak truly, which is a famous\njest.  And if he admits that they speak truly who deny him to speak\ntruly, he must admit that he himself does not speak truly.  But his\nopponents will refuse to admit this as regards themselves, and he must\nadmit that they are right in their refusal.  The conclusion is, that\nall mankind, including Protagoras himself, will deny that he speaks\ntruly; and his truth will be true neither to himself nor to anybody\nelse\" (Jowett, _Plato_, iv. pp. 239 _sqq._)\n\nThe refutation seems tolerably complete, but a good deal had to happen\nbefore Greece was ready to accept or Plato to offer such a refutation.\n\n\n\n\n{92}\n"]
