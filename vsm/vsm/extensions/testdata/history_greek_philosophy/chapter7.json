EMPEDOCLES.--Empedocles was a native of Agrigentum, a Greek colony\nin Sicily.  At the time when he flourished in his native city (circa\n440 B.C.) it was one of the wealthiest and most powerful communities in\nthat wealthy and powerful island.  It had, however, been infested, like\nits neighbours, by the designs of tyrants and the dissensions of rival\nfactions.  Empedocles was a man of high family, and he exercised the\ninfluence which his position and his abilities secured him in promoting\nand maintaining the liberty of his fellow-countrymen.  Partly on this\naccount, partly from a reputation which with or without his own will he\nacquired for an almost miraculous skill in healing and necromantic\narts, Empedocles attained to a position of singular personal power over\nhis contemporaries, and was indeed regarded as semi-divine.  His death\nwas hedged about with mystery.  According to one story he gave a great\nfeast to his friends and offered a {59} sacrifice; then when his\nfriends went to rest he disappeared, and was no more seen.  According\nto a story less dignified and better known--\n\n        Deus immortalis haberi\n  Dum cupit Empedocles, ardentem frigidus Aetnam\n  Insiluit.            HOR.  _Ad Pisones_, 464 _sqq_.\n\n\"Eager to be deemed a god, Empedocles coldly threw himself in burning\nEtna.\"  The fraud, it was said, was detected by one of his shoes being\ncast up from the crater.  Whatever the manner of his end, the Etna\nstory may probably be taken as an ill-natured joke of some sceptic wit;\nand it is certain that no such story was believed by his\nfellow-citizens, who rendered in after years divine honours to his name.\n\nLike Xenophanes, Parmenides, and other Graeco-Italian philosophers, he\nexpounded his views in verse; but he reached a poetic excellence\nunattained by any predecessor.  Aristotle characterises his gift as\nHomeric, and himself as a master of style, employing freely metaphors\nand other poetic forms.  Lucretius also speaks of him in terms of high\nadmiration (_De Nat. Rer. i. 716 sqq._): \"Foremost among them is\nEmpedocles of Agrigentum, child of the island with the triple capes, a\nland wondrous deemed in many wise, and worthy to be viewed of all men.\nRich it is in all manner of good things, and strong {60} in the might\nof its men, yet naught within its borders men deem more divine or more\nwondrous or more dear than her illustrious son.  Nay, the songs which\nissued from his godlike breast are eloquent yet, and expound his\nfindings wondrous well, so that hardly is he thought to have been of\nmortal clay.\"\n\n[180]\n\nLike the Eleatics he denies that the senses are an absolute test of\ntruth.  \"For straitened are the powers that have been shed upon our\nframes, and many the frets that cross us and defeat our care, and short\nthe span of unsatisfying existence wherein 'tis given us to see.\nShortlived as a wreath of smoke men rise and fleet away, persuaded but\nof that alone which each has chanced to light upon, driven hither and\nthither, and vainly do they pray to find _the whole_.  For this men may\nnot see or hear or grasp with the hand of thought.\"  Yet that there is\na kind or degree of knowledge possible for man his next words suggest\nwhen he continues: \"Thou therefore since hither thou hast been borne,\nhear, and thou shalt learn so much as 'tis given to mortal thought to\nreach.\"  Then follows an invocation in true Epic style to the\n\"much-wooed white-armed virgin Muse,\" wherein he prays that \"folly and\nimpurity may be far from the lips of him the teacher, and that sending\nforth her swift-reined chariot from the shrine of Piety, the Muse may\ngrant him to hear so much as is given to mortal hearing.\"\n\n{61}\n\nThen follows a warning uttered by the Muse to her would-be disciple:\n\"Thee the flowers of mortal distinctions shall not seduce to utter in\ndaring of heart more than thou mayest, that thereby thou mightest soar\nto the highest heights of wisdom.  And now behold and see, availing\nthyself of every device whereby the truth may in each matter be\nrevealed, trusting not more to sight for thy learning than to hearing,\nnor to hearing with its loud echoings more than to the revelations of\nthe tongue, nor to any one of the many ways whereby there is a path to\nknowledge.  Keep a check on the revelation of the hands also, and\napprehend each matter in the way whereby it is made plain to thee.\"\n\nThe correction of the one sense by the others, and of all by reason,\nthis Empedocles deemed the surest road to knowledge.  He thus\nendeavoured to hold a middle place between the purely abstract\nreasoning of the Eleatic philosophy and the unreasoned first guesses of\nordinary observation suggested by this or that sense, and chiefly by\nthe eyes.  The senses might supply the raw materials of knowledge,\nunordered, unrelated, nay even chaotic and mutually destructive; but in\ntheir contradictions of each other he hoped to find a starting-point\nfor order amidst the seeming chaos; reason should weigh, reason should\nreject, but reason also should find a residuum of truth.\n\n{62}\n\n[181]\n\nIn our next fragment we have his enunciation in symbolical language of\nthe _four_ elements, by him first formulated: \"Hear first of all what\nare the root principles of all things, being four in number,--Zeus the\nbright shiner (_i.e._ fire), and Hera (air), and life-bearing Aidoneus\n(earth), and Nestis (water), who with her teardrops waters the fountain\nof mortality.  Hear also this other that I will tell thee.  Nothing of\nall that perisheth ever is created, nothing ever really findeth an end\nin death.  There is naught but a mingling, and a parting again of that\nwhich was mingled, and this is what men call a coming into being.\nFoolish they, for in them is no far-reaching thought, that they should\ndream that what was not before can be, or that aught which is can\nutterly perish and die.\"  Thus again Empedocles shows himself an\nEclectic; in denying that aught can come into being, he holds with the\nEleatics (see above, p. 47); in identifying all seeming creation, and\nceasing to be with certain mixtures and separations of matter eternally\nexisting, he links himself rather to the doctrine of Anaxagoras (see\nabove, p. 53).\n\n[132]\n\nThese four elements constitute the total _corpus_ of the universe,\neternal, as a whole unmoved and immovable, perfect like a sphere.  But\nwithin this sphere-like self-centred All there are eternally proceeding\nseparations and new unions of the elements of things; and every one of\nthese is at once a birth {63} and an infinity of dyings, a dying and an\ninfinity of births.  Towards this perpetual life in death, and death in\nlife, two forces work inherent in the universe.  One of these he names\nLove, Friendship, Harmony, Aphrodite goddess of Love, Passion, Joy; the\nother he calls Hate, Discord, Ares god of War, Envy, Strife.  Neither\nof the one nor of the other may man have apprehension by the senses;\nthey are spiritually discerned; yet of the first men have some\nadumbration in the creative force within their own members, which they\nname by the names of Love and Nuptial Joy.\n\nSomewhat prosaically summing up the teaching of Empedocles, Aristotle\nsays that he thus posited _six_ first principles in nature--four\nmaterial, two motive or efficient.  And he goes on to remark that in\nthe working out of his theory of nature Empedocles, though using his\noriginative principles more consistently than Anaxagoras used his\nprinciple of _Nous_ or Thought, not infrequently, nevertheless, resorts\nto some natural force in the elements themselves, or even to chance or\nnecessity.  \"Nor,\" he continues, \"has he clearly marked off the\nfunctions of his two efficient forces, nay, he has so confounded them\nthat at times it is Discord that through separation leads to new\nunions, and Love that through union causes diremption of that which was\nbefore.\"  At times, too, Empedocles seems to have had a vision of these\ntwo forces, not as the counteracting yet {64} co-operative\n_pulsations_, so to speak, of the universal life, but as rival forces\nhaving had in time their periods of alternate supremacy and defeat.\nWhile all things were in union under the influence of Love, then was\nthere neither Earth nor Water nor Air nor Fire, much less any of the\nindividual things that in eternal interchange are formed of them; but\nall was in perfect sphere-like balance, enwrapped in the serenity of an\neternal silence.  Then came the reign of Discord, whereby war arose in\nheaven as of the fabled giants, and endless change,--endless birth, and\nendless death.\n\nThese inconsistencies of doctrine, which Aristotle notes as faults in\nEmpedocles, are perhaps rather proofs of the philosophic value of his\nconceptions.  Just as Hegel in modern philosophy could only adequately\nformulate his conceptions through logical contradictions, so also,\nperhaps, under the veil of antagonisms of utterance, Empedocles sought\nto give a fuller vision,--Discord, in his own doctrine, not less than\nin his conception of nature, being thus the co-worker with Love.  The\nordinary mind for the ordinary purposes of science seeks exactness of\ndistinction in things, and language, being the creation of ordinary\nexperience, lends itself to such a purpose; the philosophic mind,\nfinding ready to its hand no forms of expression adapted to its\nconceptions, which have for their final end Union and not Distinction,\n{65} can only attain its purpose by variety, or even contradictoriness,\nof representation.  Thus to ordinary conception cause must precede\neffect; to the philosophic mind, dealing as it does with the idea of an\norganic whole, everything is at once cause and effect, is at once\ntherefore prior to and subsequent to every other, is at once the ruling\nand the ruled, the conditioning and that which is conditioned.\n\nSo, to Empedocles there are four elements, yet in the eternal\nperfection, the silent reign of Love, there are none of them.  There\nare two forces working upon these and against each other, yet each is\nlike the other either a unifying or a separating force, as one pleases\nto regard them; and in the eternal silence, the ideal perfectness,\nthere is no warfare at all.  There is joy in Love which creates, and in\ncreating destroys; there is joy in the eternal Stillness, nay, this is\nitself the ultimate joy.  There are two forces working, Love and Hate,\nyet is there but one force, and that force is Necessity.  And for final\ncontradiction, the universe is self-balanced, self-conditioned, a\nperfect sphere; therefore this Necessity is perfect self-realisation,\nand consequently perfect freedom.\n\nThe men who have had the profoundest vision of things--Heraclitus,\nEmpedocles, Socrates, Plato, ay, and Aristotle himself when he was the\nthinker and not the critic; not to speak of the great moderns, whether\npreachers or philosophers--have none of {66} them been greatly\nconcerned for consistency of expression, for a mere logical\nself-identity of doctrine.  Life in every form, nay, existence in any\nform, is a union of contradictories, a complex of antagonisms; and the\nhighest and deepest minds are those that are most adequate to have the\nvision of these antagonisms in their contrariety, and also in their\nunity; to see and hear as Empedocles did the eternal war and clamour,\nbut to discern also, as he did in it and through it and behind it and\nabout it, the eternal peace and the eternal silence.\n\nPhilosophy, in fact, is a form of poesy; it is, if one pleases so to\ncall it, 'fiction founded upon fact.'  It is not for that reason the\nless noble a form of human thought, rather is it the more noble, in the\nsame way as poetry is nobler than mere narrative, and art than\nrepresentation, and imagination than perception.  Philosophy is indeed\none of the noblest forms of poetry, because the facts which are its\nbasis are the profoundest, the most eternally interesting, the most\nuniversally significant.  And not only has it nobility in respect of\nthe greatness of its subject matter, it has also possibilities of an\nessential truth deeper and more far-reaching and more fruitful than any\ndemonstrative system of fact can have.  A great poem or work of art of\nany kind is an adumbration of truths which transcend any actual fact,\nand as such it brings us nearer to the underlying fundamentals of {67}\nreality which all actual occurrences only by accumulation _tend_ to\nrealise.  Philosophy, then, in so far as it is great, is, like other\ngreat art, prophetic in both interpretations of the word, both as\nexpounding the inner truth that is anterior to actuality, and also as\nanticipating that final realisation of all things for which 'the whole\ncreation groaneth.'  It is thus at the basis of religion, of art, of\nmorals; it is the accumulated sense of the highest in man with respect\nto what is greatest and most mysterious in and about him.\n\nThe facts, indeed, with which philosophy attempts to deal are so vital\nand so vast that even the greatest intellects may well stagger\noccasionally under the burden of their own conceptions of them.  To\nrise to the height of such an argument demands a more than Miltonic\nimagination; and criticisms directed only at this or that fragment of\nthe whole are as irrelevant, if not as inept, as the criticism of the\nmathematician directed against _Paradise Lost_, that it 'proved\nnothing.'  The mystery of being and of life, the true purport and\nreality of this world of which we seem to be a part, and yet of which\nwe seem to have some apprehension as though we were other than a part;\nthe strange problems of creation and change and birth and death, of\nlove and sin and purification; of a heaven dreamt of or believed in, or\nsomehow actually apprehended; of life here, and of an immortality\nyearned after and hoped for--these {68} problems, these mysteries, no\nphilosophy ever did or ever can empty of their strangeness, or bring\ndown to the level of the commonplace 'certainties' of daily life or of\nscience, which are no more than shadows after all, that seem\ncertainties because of the background of mystery on which they are cast.\n\nBut just as an individual is a higher being, a fuller, more truly human\ncreature, when he has got so far removed from the merely animal\nexistence as to realise that there are such problems and mysteries, so\nalso the humanisation of the race, the development of its noblest\npeoples and its noblest literatures, have been conditioned by the\nsuccessive visions of these mysteries in more and more complex\norganisation by the great philosophers and poets and preachers.  The\nsystems of such men may die, but such deaths mean, as Empedocles said\nof the ordinary deaths of things, only an infinity of new births.\nBeing dead, their systems yet speak in the inherited language and ideas\nand aspirations and beliefs that form the never-ending, still-renewing\nmaterial for new philosophies and new faiths.  In Thales, Heraclitus,\nPythagoras, Parmenides, Empedocles we have been touching hands with an\napostolic succession of great men and great thinkers and great\npoets--men of noble life and lofty thoughts, true prophets and\nrevealers.  And the apostolic succession even within the Greek world\ndoes not fail for centuries yet.\n\n{69}\n\nPassing from the general conceptions of Empedocles to those more\nparticular rationalisations of particular problems which very largely\nprovided the motive of early philosophies, while scientific methods\nwere in an undeveloped and uncritical condition, we may notice such\ninteresting statements as the following: [135] \"The earth, which is at\nthe centre of the sphere of the universe, remains firm, because the\nspin of the universe as a whole keeps it in its place like the water in\na spinning cup.\"  He has the same conception of the early condition of\nthe earth as in other cosmogonies.  At first it was a chaos of watery\nslough, which slowly, under the influence of sky and sun, parted off\ninto earth and sea.  The sea was the 'sweat' of the earth, and by\nanalogy with the sweat it was salt.  The heavens, on the other hand,\nwere formed of air and fire, and the sun was, as it were, a speculum at\nwhich the effulgence and the heat of the whole heavens concentrated.\nBut that the aether and the fire had not been fully separated from\nearth and water he held to be proved by the hot fountains and fiery\nphenomena which must have been so familiar to a native of Sicily.\nCuriously enough he imagined fire to possess a solidifying power, and\ntherefore attributed to it the solidity of the earth and the hardness\nof the rocks.  No doubt he had observed some effects of fire in\n'metamorphic' formations in his own vicinity.\n\n{70}\n\n[137]\n\nHe had also a conception of the gradual development on the earth of\nhigher and higher forms of life, the first being rude and imperfect,\nand a 'struggle for existence' ensuing in which the monstrous and the\ndeficient gradually were eliminated--the \"two-faced, the\ndouble-breasted, the oxen-shaped with human prows, or human-shaped with\nhead of ox, or hemaphrodite,\" and so forth.  Love and Strife worked out\ntheir ends upon these varied forms; some procreated and reproduced\nafter their image, others were incapable of reproduction from mere\nmonstrosity or [138] weakness, and disappeared.  Something other than\nmere chance thus governed the development of things; there was a law, a\nreason, a _Logos_ governing the process.  This law or reason he perhaps\nfancifully illustrated by attributing the different characters of flesh\nand sinew and bone to the different numerical proportions, in which\nthey severally contain the different elements.\n\nOn this Aristotle, keen-scented critic as he was, has a question, or\nseries of questions, to ask as to the relation between this Logos, or\nprinciple of orderly combination, and Love as the ruling force in all\nunions of things.  \"Is Love,\" he asks, \"a cause of mixtures of any\nsort, or only of such sorts as Logos dictates?  And whether then is\nLove identical with this Logos, or are they separate and distinct; and\nif so, what settles their separate functions?\"  Questions {71} which\nEmpedocles did not answer, and perhaps would not have tried to answer\nhad he heard them.\n\n[139]\n\nThe soul or life-principle in man Empedocles regarded as an ordered\ncomposite of all the elements or principles of the life in nature, and\nin this kinship of the elements in man and the elements in nature he\nfound a rationale of our powers of perception.  \"By the earth,\" said\nhe, \"we have perception of earth; by water we have perception of water;\nof the divine aether, by aether; of destructive fire, by fire; of love,\nby love; of strife, by strife.\"  He therefore, as Aristotle observes,\ndrew no radical distinction between sense-apprehension and thought.  He\nlocated the faculty of apprehension more specifically in the blood,\nconceiving that in it the combination of the elements was most\ncomplete.  And the variety of apprehensive gift in different persons he\nattributed to the greater or lesser perfectness of this blood mixture\nin them individually.  Those that were dull and stupid had a relative\ndeficiency of the lighter and more invisible elements; those that were\nquick and impulsive had a relatively larger proportion of these.\nAgain, specific faculties depended on local perfection of mixture in\ncertain organs; orators having this perfectness in their tongues,\ncunning craftsmen possessing it in their hands, and so on.  And the\ndegrees of capacity of sensation, which he found in various animals, or\neven plants, he explained in similar fashion.\n\n{72} The process of sensation he conceived to be conditioned by an\nactual emission from the bodies perceived of elements or images of\nthemselves which found access to our apprehension through channels\n[140] congruous to their nature.  But ordering, criticising, organising\nthese various apprehensions was the Mind or _Nous_, which he conceived\nto be of divine nature, to be indeed an expression or emanation of the\nDivine.  And here has been preserved a strangely interesting passage,\nin which he incorporates and develops in characteristic fashion the\ndoctrine of transmigration [141] of souls: \"There is a decree of\nNecessity, a law given of old from the gods, eternal, sealed with\nmighty oaths, that when any heavenly creature (daemon) of those that\nare endowed with length of days, shall in waywardness of heart defile\nhis hands with sin of deed or speech, he shall wander for thrice ten\nthousand seasons far from the dwellings of the blest, taking upon him\nin length of time all manner of mortal forms, traversing in turn the\nmany toilsome paths of existence.  Him the aetherial wrath hurries\nonward to the deep, and the deep spews him forth on to the threshold of\nearth, and unworn earth casts him up to the fires of the sun, and again\nthe aether hurls him into the eddies.  One receives him, and then\nanother, but detested is he of them all.  Of such am I also one, an\nexile and a wanderer from God, a slave to strife and its madness.\"\n\n{73}\n\nThus to his mighty conception the life of all creation, and not of man\nonly, was a great expiation, an eternal round of punishment for sin;\nand in the unending flux of life each creature rose or fell in the\nscale of existence according to the deeds of good or ill done in each\nsuccessive life; rising sometimes to the state of men, or among men to\nthe high functions of physicians and prophets and kings, or among\nbeasts to the dignity of the lion, or among trees to the beauty of the\nlaurel; or, on the contrary, sinking through sin to lowest forms of\nbestial or vegetable life.  Till at the last they who through obedience\nand right-doing have expiated their wrong, are endowed by the blessed\ngods with endless honour, to dwell for ever with them and share their\nbanquets, untouched any more with human care and sorrow and pain.\n\n[143]\n\nThe slaying of any living creature, therefore, Empedocles, like\nPythagoras, abhorred, for all were kin.  All foul acts were forms of\nworse than suicide; life should be a long act of worship, of expiation,\nof purification.  And in the dim past he pictured a vision of a golden\nage, in which men worshipped not many gods, but Love only, and not with\nsacrifices of blood, but with pious images, and cunningly odorous\nincense, and offerings of fragrant myrrh.  With abstinence also, and\nabove all with that noblest abstinence, the abstinence from vice and\nwrong.\n\n\n\n\n{74}\n"]
