["CHAPTER IV\n\nTHE ELEATICS\n\n_God and nature--Knowledge and opinion--Being and evolution--Love the\ncreator--The modern egotism_\n\n\n[79]\n\nI. XENOPHANES.--Xenophanes was a native of Colophon, one of the Ionian\ncities of Asia Minor, but having been forced at the age of twenty-five\nto leave his native city owing to some political revolution, he\nwandered to various cities of Greece, and ultimately to Zancle and\nCatana, Ionian colonies in Sicily, and thence to Elea or Velia, a Greek\ncity on the coast of Italy.  This city had, like Miletus, reached a\nhigh pitch of commercial prosperity, and like it also became a centre\nof philosophic teaching.  For there Xenophanes remained and founded a\nschool, so that he and his successors received the name of Eleatics.\nHis date is uncertain; but he seems to have been contemporary with\nAnaximander [80] and Pythagoras, and to have had some knowledge of the\ndoctrine of both.  He wrote in various poetic measures, using against\nthe poets, and especially against Homer and Hesiod, their own weapons,\nto [83] denounce their anthropomorphic theology.  If oxen {32} or lions\nhad hands, he said, they would have fashioned gods after their likeness\nwhich would have been as [85] authentic as Homer's.  As against these\npoets, and the popular mythology, he insisted that God must be one,\neternal, incorporeal, without beginning or ending.  [87] As Aristotle\nstrikingly expresses it, \"He looked forth over the whole heavens and\nsaid that God is one, [88] that that which is one is God.\"  The\nfavourite antitheses of his time, the definite and the indefinite,\nmovable and immovable, change-producing and by change produced--these\nand such as these, he maintained, were inapplicable to the eternally\nand [86] essentially existent.  In this there was no partition of\norgans or faculties, no variation or shadow of turning; the Eternal\nBeing was like a sphere, everywhere equal; everywhere self-identical.\n\n[84]\n\nHis proof of this was a logical one; the absolutely self-existent could\nnot be thought in conjunction with attributes which either admitted any\nexternal influencing Him, or any external influenced by Him.  The\nprevailing dualism he considered to be, as an ultimate theory of the\nuniverse, unthinkable and therefore false.  Outside the Self-existent\nthere could be no second self-existent, otherwise each would be\nconditioned by the existence of the other, and the Self-existent would\nbe gone.  Anything different from the Self-existent must be of the\nnon-existent, _i.e._ must be nothing.\n\n{33}\n\nOne can easily see in these discussions some adumbration of many\ntheological or metaphysical difficulties of later times, as of the\norigin of evil, of freewill in man, of the relation of the created\nworld to its Creator.  If these problems cannot be said to be solved\nyet, we need not be surprised that Xenophanes did not solve them.  He\nwas content to emphasise that which seemed to him to be necessary and\ntrue, that God was God, and not either a partner with, or a function\nof, matter.\n\n[89]\n\nAt the same time he recognised a world of phenomena, or, as he\nexpressed it, a world of guesswork or opinion ((Greek) _doxa_).  As to\nthe origin of things within this sphere he was ready enough to borrow\n[90] from the speculations of his predecessors.  Earth and water are\nthe sources from which we spring; and he imagined a time when there was\nneither sea nor land, but an all-pervading slough and slime; nay, many\nsuch periods of inundation and emergence had been, hence the sea-shells\non the tops of mountains and the fossils in the rocks.  Air and fire\nalso as agencies of change are sometimes referred to by him;\nanticipations in fact are visible of the fourfold classification of the\nelements which was formally made by some of his successors.\n\n[91]\n\nII. PARMENIDES.--The pupil and successor of Xenophanes was PARMENIDES,\na native of Elea.  In a celebrated dialogue of Plato bearing the name\nof {34} this philosopher he is described as visiting Socrates when the\nlatter was very young.  \"He was then already advanced in years, very\nhoary, yet noble to look upon, in years some sixty and five.\"  Socrates\nwas born about 479 B.C.  The birth of Parmenides might therefore, if\nthis indication be authentic, be about 520.  He was of a wealthy and\nnoble family, and able therefore to devote himself to a learned\nleisure.  Like his master he expounded his views in verse, and\nfragments of his poem of considerable length and importance have been\npreserved.  The title of the work was _Peri Phueos_--_Of Nature_.\n\n[93]\n\nThe exordium of the poem is one of some grandeur.  The poet describes\nhimself as soaring aloft to the sanctuary of wisdom where it is set in\nhighest aether, the daughters of the Sun being his guides; under whose\nleading having traversed the path of perpetual day and at length\nattained the temple of the goddess, he from her lips received\ninstruction in the eternal verities, and had shown to him the deceptive\nguesses of mortals.  \"'Tis for thee,\" she says, \"to hear of both,--to\nhave disclosed to thee on the one hand the sure heart of convincing\nverity, on the other hand the guesses of mortals wherein is no\nascertainment.  Nevertheless thou shalt learn of these also, that\nhaving gone through them all thou may'st see by what unsureness of path\nmust he go who goeth the way of opinion.  From such a way of searching\n{35} restrain thou thy thought, and let not the much-experimenting\nhabit force thee along the path wherein thou must use thine eye, yet\nbeing sightless, and the ear with its clamorous buzzings, and the\nchattering tongue.  'Tis by Reason that thou must in lengthened trial\njudge what I shall say to thee.\"\n\n[94]\n\nThus, like Xenophanes, Parmenides draws a deep division between the\nworld of reason and the world of sensation, between probative argument\nand the guess-work of sense-impressions.  The former is the world of\nBeing, the world of that which truly is, self-existent, uncreated,\nunending, unmoved, unchanging, ever self-poised and self-sufficient,\nlike a sphere.  [98] Knowledge is of this, and of this only, and as\nsuch, knowledge is identical with its object; for outside this known\nreality there is nothing.  In other words, Knowledge can only be of\nthat which is, and that which is alone can know.  All things which\nmortals have imagined to be realities are but words; as of the birth\nand death of things, of things which were and have ceased to be, of\nhere and there, of now and then.\n\nIt is obvious enough that in all this, and in much more to the same\neffect reiterated throughout the poem, we have no more than a\nstatement, in various forms of negation, of the inconceivability by\nhuman reason of that passage from _being_ as such, to that world of\nphenomena which is now, but was not before, {36} and will cease to\nbe,--from _being_ to _becoming_, from eternity to time, from the\ninfinite to the finite (or, as Parmenides preferred to call it, from\nthe perfect to the imperfect, the definite to the indefinite).  In all\nthis Parmenides was not contradicting such observed facts as\ngeneration, or motion, or life, or death; he was talking of a world\nwhich has nothing to do with observation; he was endeavouring to grasp\nwhat was assumed or necessarily implied as a prior condition of\nobservation, or of a world to observe.\n\nWhat he and his school seem to have felt was that there was a danger in\nall this talk of water or air or other material symbol, or even of the\n_indefinite_ or _characterless_ as the original of all,--the danger,\nnamely, that one should lose sight of the idea of law, of rationality,\nof eternal self-centred force, and so be carried away by some vision of\na gradual process of evolution from mere emptiness to fulness of being.\nSuch a position would be not dissimilar to that of many would-be\nmetaphysicians among evolutionists, who, not content with the doctrine\nof evolution as a theory in science, an ordered and organising view of\nobserved facts, will try to elevate it into a vision of what is, and\nalone is, behind the observed facts.  They fail to see that the more\nblind, the more accidental, so to speak, the process of differentiation\nmay be; the more it is shown that the struggle for existence drives the\nwheels of progress along the {37} lines of least resistance by the most\ncommonplace of mechanical necessities, in the same proportion must a\nlaw be posited behind all this process, a reason in nature which\ngathers up the beginning and the ending.  The protoplasmic cell which\nthe imagination of evolutionists places at the beginning of time as the\nstarting-point of this mighty process is not merely this or that, has\nnot merely this or that quality or possibility, it _is_; and in the\npower of that little word is enclosed a whole world of thought, which\nis there at the first, remains there all through the evolutions of the\nprotoplasm, will be there when these are done, is in fact independent\nof time and space, has nothing to do with such distinctions, expresses\nrather their ultimate unreality.  So far then as Parmenides and his\nschool kept a firm grip on this other-world aspect of nature as implied\neven in the simple word _is_, or _be_, so far they did good service in\nthe process of the world's thought.  On the other hand, he and they\nwere naturally enough disinclined, as we all are disinclined, to remain\nin the merely or mainly negative or defensive.  He would not lose his\ngrip of heaven and eternity, but he would fain know the secrets of\nearth and time as well.  And hence was fashioned the second part of his\npoem, in which he expounds his theory of the world of opinion, or\nguess-work, or observation.\n\n[99]\n\nIn this world he found two originative principles {38} at work, one\npertaining to light and heat, the other to darkness and cold.  From the\nunion of these two principles all observable things in creation come,\nand over this union a God-given power presides, whose name is Love.  Of\nthese two principles, the bright one being analogous to _Fire_, the\ndark one to _Earth_, he considered the former to be the male or\nformative element, the latter the female or passive element; the former\ntherefore had analogies to Being as such, the latter to Non-being.  The\nheavenly existences, the sun, the moon, the stars, are of pure Fire,\nhave therefore an eternal and unchangeable being; they are on the\nextremest verge of the universe, and corresponding to them at the\ncentre is another fiery sphere, which, itself unmoved, is the cause of\nall motion and generation in the mixed region between.  The motive and\nprocreative power, sometimes called Love, is at other times called by\nParmenides Necessity, Bearer of the Keys, Justice, Ruler, etc.\n\nBut while in so far as there was union in the production of man or any\nother creature, the [102] presiding genius might be symbolised as\n_Love_; on the other hand, since this union was a union of opposites\n(Light and Dark), _Discord_ or _Strife_ also had her say in the union.\nThus the nature and character in every creature was the resultant of\ntwo antagonistic forces, and depended for its particular excellence or\ndefect on the proportions in which these two elements--the {39} light\nand the dark, the fiery and the earthy--had been commingled.\n\nNo character in Greek antiquity, at least in the succession of\nphilosophic teachers, held a more honoured position than Parmenides.\nHe was looked on with almost superstitious reverence by his\nfellow-countrymen.  Plato speaks of him as his \"Father Parmenides,\"\nwhom he \"revered and honoured more than all the other philosophers\ntogether.\"  To quote Professor Jowett in his introduction to Plato's\ndialogue _Parmenides_, he was \"the founder of idealism and also of\ndialectic, or in modern phraseology, of metaphysics and of logic.\"  Of\nthe logical aspect of his teaching we shall see a fuller\nexemplification in his pupil and successor Zeno; of his metaphysics, by\nway of summing up what has been already said, it may be remarked that\nits substantial excellence consists in the perfect clearness and\nprecision with which Parmenides enunciated as fundamental in any theory\nof the knowable universe the priority of Existence itself, not in time\nmerely or chiefly, but as a condition of having any problem to inquire\ninto.  He practically admits that he does not see how to bridge over\nthe partition between Existence in itself and the changeful, temporary,\nexisting things which the senses give us notions of.  But whatever the\nconnection may be, if there is a connection, he is convinced that\nnothing would be more absurd than {40} to make the data of sense in any\nway or degree the measure of the reality of existence, or the source\nfrom which existence itself comes into being.\n\nOn this serenely impersonal position he took his stand; we find little\nor nothing of the querulous personal note so characteristic of much\nmodern philosophy.  We never find him asking, \"What is to become of\n_me_ in all this?\"  \"What is _my_ position with regard to this\neternally-existing reality?\"\n\nOf course this is not exclusively a characteristic of Parmenides, but\nof the time.  The idea of personal relation to an eternal Rewarder was\nonly vaguely held in historical times in Greece.  The conception of\npersonal immortality was a mere pious opinion, a doctrine whispered\nhere and there in secret mystery; it was not an influential force on\nmen's motives or actions.  Thought was still occupied with the wider\nuniverse, the heavens and their starry wonders, and the strange\nphenomena of law in nature.  In the succession of the seasons, the\nrising and setting, the fixities and aberrations, of the heavenly\nbodies, in the mysteries of coming into being and passing out of it, in\nthese and other similar marvels, and in the thoughts which they evoked,\na whole and ample world seemed open for inquiry.  Men and their fate\nwere interesting enough to men, but as yet the egotism of man had not\nattempted to isolate his destiny from the general problem of nature.\n{41} To the _crux_ of philosophy as it appeared to Parmenides in the\nrelation of being as such to things which seem to be, modernism has\nappended a sort of corollary, in the relation of being as such to _my_\nbeing.  Till the second question was raised its answer, of course,\ncould not be attempted.  But all those who in modern times have said\nwith Tennyson--\n\n  Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:\n    Thou madest man, he knows not why;\n    He thinks he was not made to die;\n  And Thou hast made him: Thou art just,\n\nmay recognise in Parmenides a pioneer for them.  Without knowing it, he\nwas fighting the battle of personality in man, as well as that of\nreality in nature.\n\n\n\n\n{42}\n"]
