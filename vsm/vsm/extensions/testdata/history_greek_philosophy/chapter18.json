["CHAPTER XVIII\n\nARISTOTLE\n\n_An unruly pupil--The philosopher's library--The predominance of\nAristotle--Relation to Plato--The highest philosophy--Ideas and\nthings--The true realism_\n\n\nPlato before his death bequeathed his Academy to his nephew Speusippus,\nwho continued its president for eight years; and on his death the\noffice passed to Xenocrates, who held it for twenty-five years.  From\nhim it passed in succession to Polemo, Crates, Crantor, and others.\nPlato was thus the founder of a school or sect of teachers who busied\nthemselves with commenting, expanding, modifying here and there the\ndoctrines of the master.  Little of their works beyond the names has\nbeen preserved, and indeed we can hardly regret the loss.  These men no\ndoubt did much to popularise the thoughts of their master, and in this\nway largely influenced the later development of philosophy; but they\nhad nothing substantial to add, and so the stern pruning-hook of time\nhas cut them off from remembrance.\n\n[297]\n\nAristotle was the son of a Greek physician, member of the colony of\nStagira in Thrace.  His father, Nicomachus by name, was a man of such\n{173} eminence in his profession as to hold the post of physician to\nAmyntas, king of Macedonia, father of Philip the subverter of Greek\nfreedom.  Not only was his father an expert physician, he was also a\nstudent of natural history, and wrote several works on the subject.  We\nshall find that the fresh element which Aristotle brought to the\nAcademic philosophy was in a very great measure just that minute\nattention to details and keen apprehension of vital phenomena which we\nmay consider he inherited from his father.  He was born 384 B.C., and\non the death of his father, in his eighteenth year, he came to Athens,\nand became a student of philosophy under Plato, whose pupil he\ncontinued to be for twenty years,--indeed till the death of the master.\nThat he, undoubtedly a far greater man than Speusippus or Xenocrates,\nshould not have been nominated to the succession has been variously\nexplained; he is said to have been lacking in respect and gratitude to\nthe master; Plato is said to have remarked of him that he needed the\ncurb as much as Xenocrates needed the spur.  The facts really need no\nexplanation.  The original genius is never sufficiently subordinate and\namenable to discipline.  He is apt to be critical, to startle his\neasy-going companions with new and seemingly heterodox views, he is the\n'ugly duckling' whom all the virtuous and commonplace brood must cackle\n{174} at.  The Academy, when its great master died, was no place for\nAristotle.  He retired to Atarneus, a city of Mysia opposite to Lesbos,\nwhere a friend named Hermias was tyrant, and there he married Hermias'\nniece.  After staying at Atarneus some three years he was invited by\nPhilip, now king of Macedon, to undertake the instruction of his son\nAlexander, the future conqueror, who was then thirteen years old.  He\nremained with Alexander for eight years, though of course he could\nhardly be regarded as Alexander's tutor during all that time, since\nAlexander at a very early age was called to take a part in public\naffairs.  However a strong friendship was formed between the\nphilosopher and the young prince, and in after years Alexander loaded\nhis former master with benefits.  Even while on his march of conquest\nthrough Asia he did not forget him, but sent him from every country\nthrough which he passed specimens which might help him in his projected\nHistory of Animals, as well as an enormous sum of money to aid him in\nhis investigations.\n\nAfter the death of Philip, Aristotle returned to Athens, and opened a\nschool of philosophy on his own account in the Lyceum.  Here some\nauthorities tell us he lectured to his pupils while he paced up and\ndown before them; hence the epithet applied to the school, the\n_Peripatetics_.  Probably, however, the name is derived from the\n'Peripati' or covered {175} walks in the neighbourhood of that temple\nin which he taught.  He devoted his mornings to lectures of a more\nphilosophical and technical character; to these only the abler and more\nadvanced students were admitted.  In the afternoons he lectured on\nsubjects of a more popular kind--rhetoric, the art of politics,\netc.--to larger audiences.  Corresponding with this division, he also\nwas in the habit of classifying his writings as Acroatic or technical,\nand Exoteric or popular.  He accumulated a large library and museum, to\nwhich he contributed an astonishing number of works of his own, on\nevery conceivable branch of knowledge.\n\nThe after history of Aristotle's library, including the MSS. of his own\nworks, is interesting and even romantic.  Aristotle's successor in the\nschool was Theophrastus, who added to the library bequeathed him by\nAristotle many works of his own, and others purchased by him.\nTheophrastus bequeathed the entire library to Neleus, his friend and\npupil, who, on leaving Athens to reside at Scepsis in the Troad, took\nthe library with him.  There it remained for nearly two hundred years\nin possession of the Neleus family, who kept the collection hidden in a\ncellar for fear it should be seized to increase the royal library of\nPergamus.  In such a situation the works suffered much harm from worms\nand damp, till at last (_circa_ 100 B.C.) they were brought out {176}\nand sold to one Apellicon, a rich gentleman resident in Athens, himself\na member of the Peripatetic school.  In 86 B.C. Sulla, the Roman\ndictator, besieged and captured Athens, and among other prizes conveyed\nthe library of Apellicon to Rome, and thus many of the most important\nworks of Aristotle for the first time were made known to the Roman and\nAlexandrian schools.  It is a curious circumstance that the philosopher\nwhose influence was destined to be paramount for more than a thousand\nyears in the Christian era, was thus deprived by accident of his\nlegitimate importance in the centuries immediately following his own.\n\nBut his temporary and accidental eclipse was amply compensated in the\neffect upon the civilised world which he subsequently exercised.  So\nall-embracing, so systematic, so absolutely complete did his philosophy\nappear, that he seemed to after generations to have left nothing more\nto discover.  He at once attained a supremacy which lasted for some two\nthousand years, not only over the Greek-speaking world, but over every\nform of the civilisation of that long period, Greek, Roman, Syrian,\nArabic, from the Euphrates to the Atlantic, from Africa to Britain.\nHis authority was accepted equally by the learned doctors of Moorish\nCordova and the Fathers of the Church; to know Aristotle was to have\nall {177} knowledge; not to know him was to be a boor; to deny him was\nto be a heretic.\n\nHis style has nothing of the grace of Plato; he illuminates his works\nwith no myths or allegories; his manner is dry, sententious, familiar,\nwithout the slightest attempt at ornament.  There are occasional\ntouches of caustic humour, but nothing of emotion, still less of\nrhapsody.  His strength lies in the vast architectonic genius by which\nhe correlates every domain of the knowable in a single scheme, and in\nthe extraordinary faculty for illustrative detail with which he fills\nthe scheme in every part.  He knows, and can shrewdly criticise every\nthinker and writer who has preceded him; he classifies them as he\nclassifies the mental faculties, the parts of logical speech, the parts\nof sophistry, the parts of rhetoric, the parts of animals, the parts of\nthe soul, the parts of the state; he defines, distinguishes, combines,\nclassifies, with the same sureness and minuteness of method in them\nall.  He can start from a general conception, expand it into its parts,\nseparate these again by distinguishing details till he brings the\nmatter down to its lowest possible terms, or _infimae species_.  Or he\ncan start from these, find analogies among them constituting more\ngeneral species, and so in ascending scale travel surely up to a\ngeneral conception, or _summum genus_.\n\nIn his general conception of philosophy he was {178} to a large extent\nin agreement with Plato; but he endeavoured to attain to a more\ntechnical precision; he sought to systematise into greater\ncompleteness; he pared off everything which he considered merely\nmetaphorical or fanciful, and therefore non-essential.  The operations\nof nature, the phenomena of life, were used in a much fuller and more\ndefinite way to illustrate or even formulate the theory; but in its\nmain ideas Aristotle's philosophy is Plato's philosophy.  The one\nclothed it in poetry, the other in formulae; the one had a more\nentrancing vision, the other a clearer and more exact apprehension; but\nthere is no essential divergence.\n\nAristotle's account of the origin or foundation of [300] philosophy is\nas follows (_Met_. A. 2): \"Wonder is and always has been the first\nincentive to philosophy.  At first men wondered at what puzzled them\nnear at hand, then by gradual advance they came to notice and wonder at\nthings still greater, as at the phases of the moon, the eclipses of sun\nand moon, the wonders of the stars, and the origin of the universe.\nNow he who is puzzled and in a maze regards himself as a know-nothing;\nwherefore the philosopher is apt to be fond of wondrous tales or myths.\nAnd inasmuch as it was a consciousness of ignorance that drove men to\nphilosophy, it is for the correction of this ignorance, and not for any\nmaterial utility, that the pursuit of knowledge exists.  Indeed it is,\n{179} as a rule, only when all other wants are well supplied that, by\nway of ease and recreation, men turn to this inquiry.  And thus, since\nno satisfaction beyond itself is sought by philosophy, we speak of it\nas we speak of the freeman.  We call that man free whose existence is\nfor himself and not for another; so also philosophy is of all the\nsciences the only one that is free, for it alone exists for itself.\n\n\"Moreover, this philosophy, which is the investigation of the first\ncauses of things, is the most truly educative among the sciences.  For\ninstructors are persons who show us the causes of things.  And\nknowledge for the sake of knowledge belongs most properly to that\ninquiry which deals with what is most truly a matter of knowledge.  For\nhe who is seeking knowledge for its own sake will choose to have that\nknowledge which most truly deserves the name, the knowledge, namely, of\nwhat most truly appertains to knowledge.  Now the things that most\ntruly appertain to knowledge are the first causes; for in virtue of\none's possession of these, and by deduction from these, all else comes\nto be known; we do not come to know them through what is inferior to\nthem and underlying them. . . .  The wise man ought therefore to know\nnot only those things which are the outcome and product of first\ncauses, he must be possessed of the truth as to the first causes\nthemselves.  And wisdom indeed is just this {180} thoughtful science, a\nscience of what is highest, not truncated of its head.\"\n\n[301]\n\n\"To the man, therefore, who has in fullest measure this knowledge of\nuniversals, all knowledge must lie to hand; for in a way he knows all\nthat underlies them.  Yet in a sense these universals are what men find\nhardest to apprehend, because they stand at the furthest extremity from\nthe perceptions of sense.\"\n\n[302]\n\n\"Yet if anything exist which is eternal, immovable, freed from gross\nmatter, the contemplative science alone can apprehend this.  Physical\nscience certainly cannot, for physics is of that which is ever in flux;\nnor can mathematical science apprehend it; we must look to a mode of\nscience prior to and higher than both.  The objects of physics are\nneither unchangeable nor free from matter; the objects of mathematics\nare indeed unchangeable, but we can hardly say they are free from\nmatter; they have certainly relations with matter.  But the first and\nhighest science has to do with that which is unmoved and apart from\nmatter; its function is with the eternal first causes of things.  There\nare therefore three modes of theoretical inquiry: the science of\nphysics, the science of mathematics, the science of God.  For it is\nclear that if the divine is anywhere, it must be in that form of\nexistence I have spoken of (_i.e._ in first causes). . . .  If,\ntherefore, there be {181} any form of existence immovable, this we must\nregard as prior, and the philosophy of this we must consider the first\nphilosophy, universal for the same reason that it is first.  It deals\nwith existence as such, inquiring what it is and what are its\nattributes as pure existence.\"\n\nThis is somewhat more technical than the language of Plato, but if we\ncompare it with what was said above (p. 142) we shall find an essential\nidentity.  Yet Aristotle frequently impugns Plato's doctrine of ideas,\nsometimes on the lines already [322] taken by Plato himself (above, p.\n158), sometimes in other ways.  Thus (_Met_. Z. 15, 16) he says: \"That\nwhich is _one_ cannot be in many places at one time, but that which is\ncommon or general is in many places at one time.  Hence it follows that\nno universal exists apart from the individual things.  But those who\nhold the doctrine of ideas, on one side are right, viz.  in maintaining\ntheir separate existence, if they are to be substances or existences at\nall.  On the other side they are wrong, because by the idea or form\nwhich they maintain to be separate they mean the one attribute\npredicable of many things.  The reason why they do this is because they\ncannot indicate what these supposed imperishable essences are, apart\nfrom the individual substances which are the objects of perception.\nThe result is that they simply represent them under the same forms as\n{182} those of the perishable objects of sensation which are familiar\nto our senses, with the addition of a phrase--_i.e._ they say 'man as\nsuch,' 'horse as such,' or 'the absolute man,' 'the absolute horse.'\"\n\nAristotle here makes a point against Plato and his school, inasmuch as,\nstarting from the assumption that of the world of sense there could be\nno knowledge, no apprehension fixed or certain, and setting over\nagainst this a world of general forms which were fixed and certain,\nthey had nothing with which to fill this second supposed world except\nthe data of sense as found in individuals.  Plato's mistake was in\nconfusing the mere 'this,' which is the conceived starting-point of any\nsensation, but which, like a mathematical point, has nothing which can\nbe said about it, with individual objects as they exist and are known\nin all the manifold and, in fact, infinite relations of reality.  The\nbare subject 'this' presents at the one extreme the same emptiness, the\nsame mere possibility of knowledge, which is presented at the other by\nthe bare predicate 'is.'  But Plato, having an objection to the former,\nas representing to him the merely physical and therefore the passing\nand unreal, clothes it for the nonce in the various attributes which\nare ordinarily associated with it when we say, 'this man,' 'this\nhorse,' only to strip them off successively as data of sensation, and\nso at last get, by an illusory process of {183} abstraction and\ngeneralisation, to the ultimate generality of being, which is the mere\n'is' of bare predication converted into a supposed eternal substance.\n\nAristotle was as convinced as Plato that there must be some fixed and\nimmovable object or reality corresponding to true and certain\nknowledge, but with his scientific instincts he was not content to have\nit left in a condition of emptiness, attractive enough to the more\nemotional and imaginative Plato.  And hence we have elsewhere quite as\nstrong and definite statements as those quoted above about universals\n[316] (p. 180), to the effect that existence is in the fullest and most\nreal sense to be predicated of _individual_ things, and that only in a\nsecondary sense can existence be predicated of universals, in virtue of\ntheir being found in individual things.  Moreover, among universals the\n_species_, he maintains, has more of existence in it than the genus,\nbecause it is nearer to the individual or primary existence.  For if\nyou predicate of an individual thing of what species it is, you supply\na statement more full of information and more closely connected with\nthe thing than if you predicate to what genus it belongs; for example,\nif asked, \"What is this?\" and you answer, \"A man,\" you give more\ninformation than if you say, \"A living creature.\"\n\nHow did Aristotle reconcile these two points of {184} view, the one, in\nwhich he conceives thought as starting from first causes, the most\nuniversal objects of knowledge, and descending to particulars; the\nother, in which thought starts from the individual objects, and\npredicates of them by apprehension of their properties?  The antithesis\nis no accidental one; on the contrary, it is the governing idea of his\nLogic, with its ascending process or Induction, and its descending\nprocess or Syllogism.  Was thought a mere process in an unmeaning\ncircle, the 'upward and downward way' of Plato?\n\nAs to this we may answer first that while formally Aristotle displays\nmuch the same 'dualism' or unreconciled separation of the 'thing' and\nthe 'idea' as Plato, his practical sense and his scientific instincts\nled him to occupy himself largely not with either the empty 'thing' or\nthe equally empty 'idea,' but with the true _individuals_, which are at\nthe same time the true universals, namely, real objects as known,\nhaving, so far as they are known, certain forms or categories under\nwhich you can class them, having, so far as they are not yet fully\nknown, a certain raw material for further inquiry through observation.\nIn this way Thought and Matter, instead of being in eternal and\nirreconcilable antagonism as the Real and the Unreal, become parts of\nthe same reality, the first summing up the knowledge of things already\nattained, the second symbolising the infinite {185} [317] possibilities\nof further ascertainment.  And thus the word 'Matter' is applied by\nAristotle to the highest genus, as the relatively indefinite compared\nwith the more fully defined species included under it; it is also\napplied by him to the individual object, in so far as that object\ncontains qualities not yet fully brought into predication.\n\n[319]\n\nAnd second, we observe that Aristotle introduced a new conception which\nto his view established a _vital relation_ between the universal and\nthe individual.  This conception he formulated in the correlatives,\n_Potentiality_ and _Actuality_.  With these he closely connected the\nidea of _Final Cause_.  The three to Aristotle constituted a single\nreality; they are organically correlative.  In a living creature we\nfind a number of members or organs all closely interdependent and\nmutually conditioning each other.  Each has its separate function, yet\nnone of them can perform its particular function well unless all the\nothers are performing theirs well, and the effect of the right\nperformance of function by each is to enable the others also to perform\ntheirs.  The total result of all these mutually related functions is\n_Life_; this is their End or Final Cause, which does not exist apart\nfrom them, but is constituted at every moment by them.  This Life is at\nthe same time the condition on which alone each and every one of the\nfunctions constituting it can be performed.  Thus {186} life in an\norganism is at once the end and the middle and the beginning; it is the\ncause final, the cause formal, the cause efficient.  Life then is an\n_Entelechy_, as Aristotle calls it, by which he means the realisation\nin unity of the total activities exhibited in the members of the living\norganism.\n\nIn such an existence every part is at once a potentiality and an\nactuality, and so also is the whole.  We can begin anywhere and travel\nout from that point to the whole; we can take the whole and find in it\nall the parts.\n\n\n\n\n{187}\n"]
