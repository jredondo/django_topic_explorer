["CHAPTER V\n\nTHE ELEATICS (_concluded_)\n\n_Zeno's dialectic--Achilles and the tortoise--The dilemma of being--The\nall a sphere--The dilemmas of experience_\n\n\n[106]\n\nIII. ZENO.--The third head of the Eleatic school was ZENO.  He is\ndescribed by Plato in the _Parmenides_ as accompanying his master to\nAthens on the visit already referred to (see above, p. 34), and as\nbeing then \"nearly forty years of age, of a noble figure and fair\naspect.\"  In personal character he was a worthy pupil of his master,\nbeing, like him, a devoted patriot.  He is even said to have fallen a\nvictim to his patriotism, and to have suffered bravely the extremest\ntortures at the hands of a tyrant Nearchus rather than betray his\ncountry.\n\nHis philosophic position was a very simple one.  He had nothing to add\nto or to vary in the doctrine of Parmenides.  His function was\nprimarily that of an expositor and defender of that doctrine, and his\nparticular pre-eminence consists in the ingenuity of his dialectic\nresources of defence.  He is in fact pronounced by Aristotle to have\nbeen the inventor of dialectic or systematic logic.  The relation of\n{43} the two is humorously expressed thus by Plato (Jowett, _Plato_,\nvol. iv. p. 128); \"I see, Parmenides, said Socrates, that Zeno is your\nsecond self in his writings too; he puts what you say in another way,\nand would fain deceive us into believing that he is telling us what is\nnew.  For you, in your poems, say, All is one, and of this you adduce\nexcellent proofs; and he, on the other hand, says, There is no many;\nand on behalf of this he offers overwhelming evidence.\"  To this Zeno\nreplies, admitting the fact, and adds: \"These writings of mine were\nmeant to protect the arguments of Parmenides against those who scoff at\nhim, and show the many ridiculous and contradictory results which they\nsuppose to follow from the affirmation of the One.  My answer is an\naddress to the partisans of the many, whose attack I return with\ninterest by retorting upon them that their hypothesis of the being of\nmany if carried out appears in a still more ridiculous light than the\nhypothesis of the being of one.\"\n\nThe arguments of Zeno may therefore be regarded as strictly arguments\n_in kind_; quibbles if you please, but in answer to quibbles.  The\nsecret of his method was what Aristotle calls Dichotomy--that is, he\nput side by side two contradictory propositions with respect to any\nparticular supposed real thing in experience, and then proceeded to\nshow that both these contradictories alike imply what is {44} [105]\ninconceivable.  Thus \"a thing must consist either of a finite number of\nparts or an infinite number.\"  Assume the number of parts to be finite.\nBetween them there must either be something or nothing.  If there is\nsomething between them, then the whole consists of more parts than it\nconsists of.  If there is nothing between them, then they are not\nseparated, therefore they are not parts; therefore the whole has no\nparts at all; therefore it is nothing.  If, on the other hand, the\nnumber of parts is infinite, then, the same kind of argument being\napplied, the magnitude of the whole is by infinite successive positing\nof intervening parts shown to be infinite; therefore this one thing,\nbeing infinitely large, is everything.\n\n[107]\n\nTake, again, any supposed fact, as that an arrow moves.  An arrow\ncannot move except in space.  It cannot move in space without being in\nspace.  At any moment of its supposed motion it must be in a particular\nspace.  Being in that space, it must at the time during which it is in\nit be at rest.  But the total time of its supposed motion is made up of\nthe moments composing that time, and to each of these moments the same\nargument applies; therefore either the arrow never was anywhere, or it\nalways was at rest.\n\nOr, again, take objects moving at unequal rates, as Achilles and a\ntortoise.  Let the tortoise have a start of any given length, then\nAchilles, however {45} much he excel in speed, will never overtake the\ntortoise.  For, while Achilles has passed over the originally\nintervening space, the tortoise will have passed over a certain space,\nand when Achilles has passed over this second space the tortoise will\nhave again passed over some space, and so on _ad infinitum_; therefore\nin an infinite time there must always be a space, though infinitely\ndiminishing, between the tortoise and Achilles, _i.e._ the tortoise\nmust always be at least a little in front.\n\nThese will be sufficient to show the kind of arguments employed by\nZeno.  In themselves they are of no utility, and Zeno never pretended\nthat they had any.  But as against those who denied that existence as\nsuch was a datum independent of experience, something different from a\nmere sum of isolated things, his arguments were not only effective, but\nsubstantial.  The whole modern sensational or experiential school, who\nderive our 'abstract ideas,' as they are called, from 'phenomena' or\n'sensation,' manifest the same impatience of any analysis of what they\nmean by phenomena or sensation, as no doubt Zeno's opponents manifested\nof his analyses.  As in criticising the one, modern critics are ready\nwith their answer that Zeno's quibbles are simply \"a play of words on\nthe well-known properties of infinities,\" so they are quick to tell us\nthat sensation is an \"affection of the sentient organism\"; ignoring in\n{46} the first case the prior question where the idea of infinity came\nfrom, and in the second, where the idea of a sentient organism came\nfrom.\n\nIndirectly, as we shall see, Zeno had a great effect on subsequent\nphilosophies by the development of a process of ingenious verbal\ndistinction, which in the hands of so-called sophists and others became\na weapon of considerable, if temporary, power.\n\n[109]\n\nIV. MELISSUS.--The fourth and last of the Eleatic philosophers was\nMelissus, a native of Samos.  His date may be fixed as about 440 B.C.\nHe took an active part in the politics of his native country, and on\none occasion was commander of the Samian fleet in a victorious\nengagement with the Athenians, when Samos was being besieged by\nPericles.  He belongs to the Eleatic school in respect of doctrine and\nmethod, but we have no evidence of his ever having resided at Elea, nor\nany reference to his connection with the philosophers there, except the\nstatement that he was a pupil of Parmenides.  He developed very fully\nwhat is technically called in the science of Logic [110] the _Dilemma_.\nThus, for example, he begins his treatise _On Existence_ or _On Nature_\nthus: \"If nothing exists, then there is nothing for us to talk about.\nBut if there is such a thing as existence it must either come into\nbeing or be ever-existing.  If it come into being, it must come from\nthe existing or the non-existing.  Now that anything which exists, {47}\nabove all, that which is absolutely existent, should come from what is\nnot, is impossible.  Nor can it come from that which is.  For then it\nwould be already, and would not come into being.  That which exists,\ntherefore, comes not into being; it must therefore be ever-existing.\"\n\n[111]\n\nBy similar treatment of other conceivable alternatives he proceeds to\nshow that as the existent had no beginning so it can have no ending in\ntime.  From this, by a curious transition which Aristotle quotes as an\nexample of loose reasoning, he concludes that the existent can have no\nlimit in space [112] either.  As being thus unlimited it must be one,\ntherefore immovable (there being nothing else into which it can move or\nchange), and therefore always self-identical in extent and character.\nIt cannot, therefore, have any body, for body has parts and is not\ntherefore one.\n\n[113]\n\nBeing incapable of change one might perhaps conclude that the\nabsolutely existing being is incapable of any mental activity or\nconsciousness.  We have no authority for assuming that Melissus came to\nthis conclusion; but there is a curious remark of Aristotle's\nrespecting this and previous philosophers of the school which certain\ncritics have [114] made to bear some such interpretation.  He says:\n\"Parmenides seems to hold by a Unity in thought, Melissus by a Material\nunity.  Hence the first {48} defined the One as limited, the second\ndeclared it to be unlimited.  Xenophanes made no clear statement on\nthis question; he simply, gazing up to the arch of heaven, declared,\nThe One is God.\"\n\nBut the difference between Melissus and his master can hardly be said\nto be a difference of doctrine; point for point, they are identical.\nThe difference is a difference of vision or mental picture as to this\nmighty All which is One.  Melissus, so to speak, places himself at the\ncentre of this Universal being, and sees it stretching out infinitely,\nunendingly, in space and in time.  Its oneness comes to him as the\n_sum_ of these infinities.  Parmenides, on the other hand, sees all\nthese endless immensities as related to a centre; he, so to speak,\nenfolds them all in the grasp of his unifying thought, and as thus\nequally and necessarily related to a central unity he pronounces the\nAll a sphere, and therefore limited.  The two doctrines, antithetical\nin terms, are identical in fact.  The absolutely unlimited and the\nabsolutely self-limited are only two ways of saying the same thing.\n\nThis difference of view or vision Aristotle in the passage quoted\nexpresses as a difference between _thought_ ((Greek) _logos_) and\n_matter_ ((Greek) _hule_).  This is just a form of his own radical\ndistinction between Essence and Difference, Form and Matter, of which\nmuch will be said later on.  It is like the difference {49} between\nDeduction and Induction; in the first you start from the universal and\nsee within it the particulars; in the second you start from the\nparticulars and gather them into completeness and reality in a\nuniversal.  The substance remains the same, only the point of view is\ndifferent.  To put the matter in modern mathematical form, one might\nsay, The universe is to be conceived as a _sphere_ (Parmenides) of\n_infinite radius_ (Melissus).  Aristotle is not blaming Melissus or\npraising Parmenides.  As for Xenophanes, Aristotle after his manner\nfinds in him the potentiality of both.  He is prior both to the process\nof thought from universal to particular, and to that from particular to\nuniversal.  He does not argue at all; his function is Intuition.  \"He\nlooks out on the mighty sky, and says, The One is God.\"\n\nMelissus applied the results of his analysis in an interesting way to\nthe question already raised by his predecessors, of the trustworthiness\nof sensation.  His argument is as follows: \"If there were many real\nexistences, to each of them the same reasonings must apply as I have\nalready used with reference to the one existence.  That is to say, if\nearth really exists, and water and air and iron and gold and fire and\nthings living and things dead; and black and white, and all the various\nthings whose reality men ordinarily assume,--if all these really exist,\nand our sight and our hearing give us _facts_, then each of these as\n{50} really existing must be what we concluded the one existence must\nbe; among other things, each must be unchangeable, and can never become\nother than it really is.  But assuming that sight and hearing and\napprehension are true, we find the cold becoming hot and the hot\nbecoming cold; the hard changes to soft, the soft to hard; the living\nthing dies; and from that which is not living, a living thing comes\ninto being; in short, everything changes, and what now is in no way\nresembles what was.  It follows therefore that we neither see nor\napprehend realities.\n\n\"In fact we cannot pay the slightest regard to experience without being\nlanded in self-contradictions.  We assume that there are all sorts of\nreally existing things, having a permanence both of form and power, and\nyet we imagine these very things altering and changing according to\nwhat we from time to time see about them.  If they were realities as we\nfirst perceived them, our sight must now be wrong.  For if they were\nreal, they could not change.  Nothing can be stronger than reality.\nWhereas to suppose it changed, we must affirm that the real has ceased\nto be, and that that which was not has displaced it.\"\n\nTo Melissus therefore, as to his predecessors, the world of sense was a\nworld of illusion; the very first principles or assumptions of which,\nas of the truthfulness of the senses and the reality of the various\nobjects which we see, are unthinkable and absurd.\n\n{51}\n\nThe weakness as well as the strength of the Eleatic position consisted\nin its purely negative and critical attitude.  The assumptions of\nordinary life and experience could not stand for a moment when assailed\nin detail by their subtle analysis.  So-called facts were like a world\nof ghosts, which the sword of truth passed through without resistance.\nBut somehow the sword might pierce them through and through, and show\nby all manner of arguments their unsubstantiality, but there they were\nstill thronging about the philosopher and refusing to be gone.  The\nworld of sense might be only illusion, but there the illusion was.  You\ncould not lay it or exorcise it by calling it illusion or opinion.\nWhat was this opinion?  What was the nature of its subject matter?  How\ndid it operate?  And if its results were not true or real, what was\ntheir nature?  These were questions which still remained when the\nanalysis of the idea of absolute existence had been pushed to its\ncompletion.  These were the questions which the next school of\nphilosophy attempted to answer.  After the Idealists, the Realists;\nafter the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of matter.\n\n\n\n\n{52}\n"]
