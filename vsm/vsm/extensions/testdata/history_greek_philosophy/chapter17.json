["CHAPTER XVII\n\nPLATO (_concluded_)\n\n_Search for universals--The thoughts of God--God cause and\nconsummation--Dying to earth--The Platonic education_\n\n\nIf we attempt now, by way of appendix to this very inadequate summary\nof the dialogues, to give in brief review some account of the main\ndoctrines of Plato, as they may be gathered from a general view of\nthem, we are at once met by difficulties many and serious.  In the case\nof a genius such as Plato's, at once ironical, dramatic, and\nallegorical, we cannot be absolutely certain that in any given passage\nPlato is expressing, at all events adequately and completely, his own\npersonal views, even at the particular stage of his own mental\ndevelopment then represented.  And when we add to this that in a long\nlife of unceasing intellectual development, Plato inevitably grew out\nof much that once satisfied him, and attained not infrequently to new\npoints of view even of doctrines or conceptions which remained\nessentially unchanged, a Platonic dogma in the strict sense must\nclearly not be expected.  One may, however, attempt in rough outline to\nsummarise the main {163} _tendencies_ of his thought, without\nprofessing to represent its settled and authenticated results.\n\n[251]\n\nWe may begin by an important summary of Plato's philosophy given by\nAristotle (_Met_. A. 6): \"In immediate succession to the Pythagorean\nand Eleatic philosophies came the work of Plato.  In many respects his\nviews coincided with these; in some respects, however, he is\nindependent of the Italians.  For in early youth he became a student of\nCratylus and of the school of Heraclitus, and accepted from them the\nview that the objects of sense are in eternal flux, and that of these,\ntherefore, there can be no absolute knowledge.  Then came Socrates, who\nbusied himself only with questions of morals, and not at all with the\nworld of physics.  But in his ethical inquiries his search was ever for\nuniversals, and he was the first to set his mind to the discovery of\ndefinitions.  Plato following him in this, came to the conclusion that\nthese universals could not belong to the things of sense, which were\never changing, but to some other kind of existences.  Thus he came to\nconceive of universals as forms or _ideas_ of real existences, by\nreference to which, and in consequence of analogies to which, the\nthings of sense in every case received their names, and became\nthinkable objects.\"\n\nFrom this it followed to Plato that in so far as the senses took an\nillusive appearance of themselves giving {164} the knowledge which\nreally was supplied by reason as the organ of ideas, in the same degree\nthe body which is the instrument of sense can only be a source of\nillusion and a hindrance to knowledge.  The wise man, therefore, will\nseek to free himself from the bonds of the body, and die while he lives\nby philosophic contemplation, free as far as possible from the\ndisturbing influence of the senses.  This process of _rational_\nrealisation Plato called Dialectic.  The objects contemplated by the\nreason, brought into consciousness on the occurrence of sensible\nperception, but never caused by these, were not mere notions in the\nmind of the individual thinker, nor were they mere properties of\nindividual things; this would be to make an end of science on the one\nhand, of reality on the other.  Nor had they existence in any mere\nplace, not even beyond the heavens.  Their home was Mind, not this mind\nor that, but Mind Universal, which is God.\n\nIn these 'thoughts of God' was the root or essence which gave reality\nto the things of sense; they were the Unity which realised itself in\nmultiplicity.  It is because things partake of the Idea that we give\nthem a name.  The thing as such is seen, not known; the idea as such is\nknown, not seen.\n\n[252]\n\nThe whole conception of Plato in this connection is based on the\nassumption that there is such a thing as knowledge.  If all things are\never in change, then knowledge is impossible; but conversely, if there\nis {165} such a thing as knowledge, then there must be a continuing\nobject of knowledge; and beauty, goodness, [253] reality are then no\ndreams.  The process of apprehension of these 'thoughts of God,' these\neternal objects of knowledge, whether occasioned by sensation or not,\nis essentially a process of self-inquiry, or, as he in one stage called\nit, of Reminiscence.  The process is the same in essence, whether going\non in thought or expressed in speech; it is a process of _naming_.  Not\nthat names ever resemble realities fully; they are only approximations,\nlimited by the conditions [254] of human error and human convention.\nThere is nevertheless an inter-communion between ideas and things.  We\nmust neither go entirely with those who affirm the one (the Eleatics),\nnor with those who affirm the many (the Heracliteans), but accept both.\nThere is a union in all that exists both of That Which _Is_, and of\nthat concerning which all we can say is that it is _Other_ than what\nis.  This 'Other,' through union with what is, attains to being of a\nkind; while on the other hand, What Is by union with the 'Other'\nattains to variety, and thus more fully realises itself.\n\n[258]\n\nThat which Plato here calls 'What Is' he elsewhere calls 'The Limiting\nor Defining'; the 'Other' he calls 'The Unlimited or Undefined.'  Each\nhas a function in the divine process.  The thoughts of God attain\nrealisation in the world of things which change and pass, through the\ninfusion {166} of themselves in, or the superimposing of themselves\nupon, that which is Nothing apart from them,--the mere negation of what\nis, and yet necessary as the 'Other' or correlative of what is.  Thus\nwe get, in fact, _four_ forms of existence: there is the Idea or\nLimiting (apart); there is the Negative or Unlimited (apart), there is\nthe Union of the two (represented in language by subject and\npredicate), which as a whole is this frame of things as we know it; and\nfourthly, there is the _Cause_ of the Union, which is God.  And God is\ncause not only as the beginning of all things, but also as the measure\nand law of their perfection, and the end towards which they go.  He is\nthe Good, and the cause of Good, and the consummation and realisation\nof Good.\n\nThis absolute Being, this perfect Good, we cannot see, blinded as we\nare, like men that have been dwelling in a cave, by excess of light.\nWe must, therefore, look on Him indirectly, as on an image of Him, in\nour own souls and in the world, in so far as in either we discern, by\nreason, that which is rational and good.\n\n[269]\n\nThus God is not only the cause and the end of all good, He is also the\ncause and the end of all knowledge.  Even as the sun is not only the\nmost glorious of all visible objects, but is also the cause of the life\nand beauty of all other things, and the provider of the light whereby\nwe see them, so also {167} is it for the eye of the soul.  God is its\nlight, God is the most glorious object of its contemplation, God we\nbehold imaged forth in all the objects which the soul by reason\ncontemplates.\n\n[260]\n\nThe ideas whereof the 'Other' (or, as he again calls it, the 'Great and\nSmall' or 'More and Less,' meaning that which is unnamable, or wholly\nneutral in character, and which may therefore be represented equally by\ncontradictory attributes) by participation becomes a resemblance, Plato\ncompared to the 'Numbers' of the Pythagoreans (cf. above, p. 25).\nHence, Aristotle remarks (_Met_. A. 6), Plato found in the ideas the\noriginative or formative Cause of things, that which made them what\nthey were or could be called,--their _Essence_; in the 'Great and\nSmall' he found the opposite principle or _Matter_ (Raw Material) of\nthings.\n\nIn this way the antithesis of Mind and Matter, whether on the great\nscale in creation or on the small in rational perception, is not an\nantithesis of unrelated opposition.  Each is correlative of the other,\nso to speak as the male and the female; the one is generative,\nformative, active, positive; the other is capable of being impregnated,\nreceptive, passive, negative; but neither can realise itself apart from\nthe other.\n\n[262]\n\nThis relation of 'Being' with that which is 'Other than Being' is\nCreation, wherein we can {168} conceive of the world as coming to be,\nyet not in [261] Time.  And in the same way Plato speaks of a third\nform, besides the Idea and that which receives it, namely, 'Formless\nSpace, the mother of all things.'  As Kant might have formulated it,\nTime and Space are not prior to creation, they are forms under which\ncreation becomes thinkable.\n\n[271]\n\nThe 'Other' or Negative element, Plato more or less vaguely connected\nwith the evil that is in the world.  This evil we can never expect to\nperish utterly from the world; it must ever be here as the antithesis\nof the good.  But with the gods it dwells not; here in this mortal\nnature, and in this region of mingling, it must of necessity still be\nfound.  The wise man will therefore seek to die to the evil, and while\nyet in this world of mortality, to think immortal things, and so as far\nas may be flee from the evil.  Thereby shall he liken himself to the\ndivine.  For it is a likening to the divine to be just and holy and\ntrue.\n\n[273]\n\nThis, then, is the _summum bonum_, the end of life.  For as the\nexcellence or end of any organ or instrument consists in that\nperfection of its parts, whereby each separately and the whole together\nwork well towards the fulfilling of that which it is designed to\naccomplish, so the excellence of man must consist in a perfect ordering\nof all his parts to the perfect working of his whole organism as a\n{169} [276] rational being.  The faculties of man are three: the Desire\nof the body, the Passion of the heart, the Thought of the soul; the\nperfect working of all three, Temperance, Courage, Wisdom, and\nconsequently the perfect working of the whole man, is Righteousness.\nFrom this springs that ordered tranquillity which is at once true\nhappiness and perfect virtue.\n\n[277]\n\nYet since individual men are not self-sufficient, but have separate\ncapacities, and a need of union for mutual help and comfort, the\nperfect realisation of this virtue can only be in a perfect civic [278]\ncommunity.  And corresponding with the three parts of the man there\nwill be three orders in the community: the Workers and Traders, the\nSoldiers, and the Ruling or Guardian class.  When all these perform\ntheir proper functions in perfect harmony, then is the perfection of\nthe whole realised, in Civic Excellence or Justice.\n\n[281]\n\nTo this end a careful civic education is necessary, _first_, because to\n_know_ what is for the general good is difficult, for we have to learn\nnot only in general but in detail that even the individual good can be\nsecured only through the general; and _second_, because few, if any,\nare capable of seeking the general good, even if they know it, without\nthe guidance of discipline and the restraints of law.  Thus, with a\nview to its own perfection, and the good of all {170} its members,\nEducation is the chief work of the State.\n\nIt will be remembered (see foregoing page) that in Plato's division of\nthe soul of man there are three faculties, Desire, Passion, Reason; in\nthe division of the soul's perfection three corresponding virtues,\nTemperance, Courage, Wisdom; and in the division of the state three\ncorresponding orders, Traders, Soldiers, Guardians.  So in Education\nthere are three stages.  First, _Music_ (including all manner of\nartistic and refining influences), whose function it is so to attemper\nthe desires of the heart that all animalism and sensualism may be\neliminated, and only the love and longing for that which is lovely and\nof good report may remain.  Second, _Gymnastic_, whose function it is\nthrough ordered labour and suffering so to subdue and rationalise the\npassionate part of the soul, that it may become the willing and\nobedient servant of that which is just and true.  And third,\n_Mathematics_, by which the rational element of the soul may be trained\nto realise itself, being weaned, by the ordered apprehension of the\n'diamond net' of laws which underlie all the phenomena of nature, away\nfrom the mere surface appearances of things, the accidental,\nindividual, momentary,--to the deep-seated realities, which are\nnecessary, universal, eternal.\n\nAnd just as there was a perfectness of the soul {171} transcending all\nparticular virtues, whether of Temperance or Courage or Wisdom, namely,\nthat absolute Rightness or Righteousness which gathered them all into\nitself, so at the end of these three stages of education there is a\nhigher mood of thought, wherein the soul, purified, chastened,\nenlightened, in communing with itself through _Dialectic_ (the Socratic\nart of questioning transfigured) communes also with the Divine, and in\nthinking out its own deepest thoughts, thinks out the thoughts of the\ngreat Creator Himself, becomes one with Him, finds its final\nrealisation through absorption into Him, and in His light sees light.\n\n\n\n\n{172}\n"]
