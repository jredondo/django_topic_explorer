["CHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE STOICS\n\n_Semitic admixture--Closed fist and open hand--'Tabula rasa'--Necessity\nof evil--Hymn of Cleanthes--Things indifferent--Ideal and\nreal--Philosophy and humanity_\n\n\nZeno, the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy (born _circa_ 340\nB.C.), was a native of Citium in Cyprus.  The city was Greek, but with\na large Phoenician admixture.  And it is curious that in this last and\nsternest phase of Greek thought, not the founder only, but a large\nproportion of the successive leaders of the school, came from this and\nother places having Semitic elements in them.  Among these places\nnotable as nurseries of Stoicism was Tarsus in Cilicia, the birthplace\nof St. Paul.  The times of preparation were drawing to a close; and\nthrough these men, with their Eastern intensity and capacities of\nself-searching and self-abasement, the philosophy of Greece was linking\nitself on to the wisdom of the Hebrews.\n\nZeno came to Athens to study philosophy, and for twenty years he was a\npupil first of Crates the Cynic, and then of other teachers.  At length\nhe set up a school of his own in the celebrated _Stoa {229} Poecile_\n(Painted Colonnade), so named because it was adorned with frescoes by\nPolygnotus.  There he taught for nearly sixty years, and voluntarily\nended his life when close on a century old.  His life, as Antigonus,\nKing of Macedon, recorded on his tomb, was consistent with his\ndoctrine--abstemious, [386] frugal, laborious, dutiful.  He was\nsucceeded by Cleanthes, a native of Assos in Asia [387] Minor.  But the\ngreat constructor of the Stoic doctrine, without whom, as his\ncontemporaries said, there had been no Stoic school at all, was\nChrysippus, a native of Soli or of Tarsus in Cilicia.  He wrote at\nenormous length, supporting his teachings by an immense erudition, and\nculling liberally from the poets to illustrate and enforce his views.\nLearned and pedantic, his works had no inherent attraction, and nothing\nof them but fragments has been preserved.  We know the Stoic doctrine\nmainly from the testimony and criticisms of later times.\n\n[389]\n\nLike the Epicureans, Zeno and his successors made philosophy primarily\na search for the chief good, a doctrine of practice and morals.  But\nlike them they were impelled to admit a logic and a physics, at least\nby way of preliminary basis to their [390] ethics.  The relations of\nthe three they illustrated by various images.  Philosophy was like an\nanimal; logic was its bones and sinews, ethics its flesh, physics its\nlife or soul.  Or again, philosophy was {230} an egg; logic was the\nshell, ethics the white, physics, the yolk.  Or again, it was a\nfruitful field; logic was the hedge, ethics the crop, physics the soil.\nOr it was a city, well ordered and strongly fortified, and so on.  The\nimages seem somewhat confused, but the general idea is clear enough.\nMorality was the essential, the living body, of philosophy; physics\nsupplied its raw material, or the conditions under which a moral life\ncould be lived; logic secured that we should use that material rightly\nand wisely for the end desired.\n\n[391]\n\nLogic the Stoics divided into two parts--Rhetoric, the 'science of the\nopen hand,' and Dialectic, the 'science of the closed fist,' as Zeno\ncalled them.  They indulged in elaborate divisions and subdivisions of\neach, with which we need not meddle.  The only points of interest to us\nare contained in their analysis [392] of the processes of perception\nand thought.  A sensation, Zeno taught, was the result of an external\n_impulse_, which when combined with an internal _assent_, produced a\nmental state that revealed at the same time itself and the external\nobject producing it.  The perception thus produced he compared to the\ngrip which the hand took of a solid object; and real perceptions,\nthose, that is, which were caused by a real external object, and not by\nsome illusion, always testified to the reality of their cause by this\nsensation of 'grip.'\n\n{231}\n\nThe internal assent of the mind was voluntary, and at the same time\nnecessary; for the mind could not do otherwise than will the acceptance\nof that which it was fitted to receive.  The peculiarity of their\nphysics, which we shall have to refer to later on, namely, the denial\nof the existence of anything not material, implied that in some way\nthere was a material action of the external object on the structure of\nthe perceiving mind (itself also material).  What exactly the nature of\nthis action was the Stoics themselves were not quite agreed.  The idea\nof an 'impression' such as a seal makes upon wax was a tempting one,\nbut they had difficulty in comprehending how there could be a multitude\nof different impressions on the same spot without effacing each other.\nSome therefore preferred the vaguer and safer expression,\n'modification'; had they possessed our modern science, they might have\nillustrated their meaning by reference to the phenomena of magnetism or\nelectricity.\n\nAn interesting passage may be quoted from [393] Plutarch on the Stoic\ndoctrine of knowledge: \"The Stoics maintain,\" he says, \"that when a\nhuman being is born, he has the governing part of his soul like a sheet\nof paper ready prepared for the reception of writing, and on this the\nsoul inscribes in succession its various ideas.  The first form of the\nwriting is produced through the senses.  When we perceive, for example,\n{232} a white object, the recollection remains when the object is gone.\nAnd when many similar recollections have accumulated, we have what is\ncalled _experience_.  Besides the ideas which we get in this natural\nand quite undesigned way, there are other ideas which we get through\nteaching and information.  In the strict sense only these latter ought\nto be called ideas; the former should rather be called perceptions.\nNow the rational faculty, in virtue of which we are called reasoning\nbeings, is developed out of, or over and beyond, the mass of\nperceptions, in the second seven years' period of life.  In fact a\nthought may be defined as a kind of mental image, such as a rational\nanimal alone is capable of having.\"\n\nThus there are various gradations of mental apprehensions; first, those\nof sensible qualities obtained through the action of the objects and\nthe assent of the perceiving subject, as already described; then by\nexperience, by comparison, by analogy, by the combinations of the\nreasoning faculty, further and more general notions are arrived at, and\nconclusions formed, as, for example, that the gods exist and exercise a\nprovidential care over the world.  By this faculty also the wise man\nascends to the apprehension of the good and true.\n\nThe physics of the Stoics started from the fundamental [398]\nproposition that in the universe of things there were two elements--the\nactive and the passive.  {233} The latter was Matter or unqualified\nexistence; the former was the reason or qualifying element in Matter,\nthat is, God, who being eternal, is the fashioner of every individual\nthing throughout the universe of matter.  God is One; He is Reason, and\nFate, and Zeus.  In fact all the gods are only various representations\nof His faculties and powers.  He being from the beginning of things by\nHimself, turneth all existence through air to water.  And even as the\ngenital seed is enclosed in the semen, so also was the seed of the\nworld concealed in the water, making its matter apt for the further\nbirth of things; then first it brought into being the four\nelements--fire, water, air, earth.  For there was a finer fire or air\nwhich was the moving spirit of things; later and lower than this were\nthe material elements of fire and air.  It follows that the universe of\nthings is threefold; there is first God Himself, the source of all\ncharacter and individuality, who is indestructible and eternal, the\nfashioner of all things, who in certain cycles of ages gathers up all\nthings into Himself, and then out of Himself brings them again to\nbirth; there is the matter of the universe whereon God works; and\nthirdly, there is the union of the two.  Thus the world is governed by\nreason and forethought, and this reason extends through every part,\neven as the soul or life extends to every part of us.  The universe\ntherefore is a living thing, having a {234} soul or reason in it.  This\nsoul or reason one teacher likened to the air, another to the sky,\nanother to the sun.  For the soul of nature is, as it were, a finer air\nor fire, having a power of creation in it, and moving in an ordered way\nto the production of things.\n\n[399]\n\nThe universe is one and of limited extension, being spherical in form,\nfor this is the form which best adapts itself to movement.  Outside\nthis universe is infinite bodiless space; but within the universe there\nis no empty part; all is continuous and united, as is proved by the\nharmony of relation which exists between the heavenly bodies and those\nupon the earth.  The world as such is destructible, for its parts are\nsubject to change and to decay; yet is this change or destruction only\nin respect of the qualities imposed upon it from time to time by the\nReason inherent in it; the mere unqualified Matter remains\nindestructible.\n\n[408]\n\nIn the universe evil of necessity exists; for evil being the opposite\nof good, where no evil is there no good can be.  For just as in a\ncomedy there are absurdities, which are in themselves bad, but yet add\na certain attraction to the poem as a whole, so also one may blame evil\nregarded in itself, yet for the whole it is not without its use.  So\nalso God is the cause of death equally with birth; for even as cities\nwhen the inhabitants have multiplied overmuch, {235} remove their\nsuperfluous members by colonisation or by war, so also is God a cause\nof destruction.  In man in like manner good cannot exist save with\nevil; for wisdom being a knowledge of good and evil, remove the evil\nand wisdom itself goes.  Disease and other natural evils, when looked\nat in the light of their effects, are means not of evil but of good;\nthere is throughout the universe a balance and interrelation of good\nand evil.  Not that God hath in Himself any evil; the law is not the\ncause of lawlessness, nor God Himself responsible for any violation of\nright.\n\n[404]\n\nThe Stoics indulged in a strange fancy that the world reverted after a\nmighty cycle of years in all its parts to the same form and structure\nwhich it possessed at the beginning, so that there would be once more a\nSocrates, a Plato, and all the men that had lived, each with the same\nfriends and fellow-citizens, the same experiences, and the same\nendeavours.  At the termination of each cycle there was a burning up of\nall things, and thereafter a renewal of the great round of life.\n\n[408]\n\nNothing incorporeal, they maintained, can be affected by or affect that\nwhich is corporeal; body alone can affect body.  The soul therefore\nmust be corporeal.  Death is the separation of soul from body, but it\nis impossible to separate what is incorporeal from body; therefore,\nagain, the soul must {236} be corporeal.  In the belief of Cleanthes,\nthe souls of all creatures remained to the next period of cyclic\nconflagration; Chrysippus believed that only the souls of the wise and\ngood remained.\n\n[413]\n\nComing finally to the Ethics of the Stoic philosophy, we find for the\nchief end of life this definition, 'A life consistent with itself,' or,\nas it was otherwise expressed, 'A life consistent with Nature.'  The\ntwo definitions are really identical; for the law of nature is the law\nof our nature, and the reason in our being the reason which also is in\nGod, the supreme Ruler of the universe.  This is substantially in\naccordance with the celebrated law of right action laid down by Kant,\n\"Act so that the maxim of thine action be capable of being made a law\nof universal action.\"  Whether a man act thus or no, by evil if not by\ngood the eternal law will satisfy itself; the question is of import\nonly for the man's own happiness.  Let his will accord with the\nuniversal will, then the law will be fulfilled, and the man will be\nhappy.  Let his will resist the universal will, then the law will be\nfulfilled, but the man will bear the penalty.  This was expressed by\nCleanthes in a hymn which ran somewhat thus--\n\n      Lead me, O Zeus most great,\n      And thou, Eternal Fate:\n  What way soe'er thy will doth bid me travel\n  That way I'll follow without fret or cavil.\n  {237}\n      Or if I evil be\n      And spurn thy high decree,\n  Even so I still shall follow, soon or late.\n\n\nThus in the will alone consists the difference of good or ill for us;\nin either case Nature's great law fulfils itself infallibly.  To their\nview on this point we may apply the words of Hamlet: \"If it be now,\n'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not\nnow, yet it will come; the _readiness_ is all.\"\n\nThis universal law expresses itself in us in various successive\nmanifestations.  From the moment of birth it implants in us a supreme\nself-affection, whereby of infallible instinct we seek our own\nself-preservation, rejoice in that which is suitable to our existence,\nshrink from that which is unsuitable.  As we grow older, further and\nhigher principles manifest themselves--reason and reflection, a more\nand more careful and complete apprehension of that which is honourable\nand advantageous, a capacity of choice among goods.  Till finally the\nsurpassing glory of that which is just and honourable shines out so\nclear upon us, that any pain or loss is esteemed of no account, if only\nwe may attain to that.  Thus at last, by the very law of our being, we\ncome to know that nothing is truly and absolutely good but goodness,\nnothing absolutely bad but sin.  Other things, inasmuch as they have no\ncharacter of moral good {238} or moral evil, cannot be deemed really\ngood or bad; in comparison with the absolutely good, they are things\nindifferent, though in comparison with each other they may be\nrelatively preferable or relatively undesirable.  Even pleasure and\npain, so far as concerns the absolute end or happiness of our being,\nare things indifferent; we cannot call them either good or evil.  Yet\nhave they a relation to the higher law, for the consciousness of them\nwas so implanted in us at the first that our souls by natural impulse\nare drawn to pleasure, while they shrink from pain as from a deadly\nenemy.  Wherefore reason neither can nor ought to seek wholly to\neradicate these primitive and deep-seated affections of our nature; but\nso to exercise a resisting and ordering influence upon them, as to\nrender them obedient and subservient to herself.\n\n[415]\n\nThat which is absolutely good--wisdom, righteousness, courage,\ntemperance--does good only and never ill to us.  All other\nthings,--life, health, pleasure, beauty, strength, wealth, reputation,\nbirth,--and their opposites,--death, disease, pain, deformity,\nweakness, poverty, contempt, humility of station,--these are in\nthemselves neither a benefit nor a curse.  They may do us good, they\nmay do us harm.  We may use them for good, we may use them for evil.\n\n[417]\n\nThus the Stoics worked out on ideal and absolute lines the thought of\nrighteousness as the chief and {239} only good.  Across this ideal\npicture were continually being drawn by opponents without or inquirers\nwithin, clouds of difficulty drawn from real experience.  'What,' it\nwas asked, 'of _progress_ in goodness?  Is this a middle state between\ngood and evil; or if a middle state between good and evil be a\ncontradiction, in terms, how may we characterise it?'  Here the wiser\nteachers had to be content to answer that it _tended_ towards good, was\ngood in possibility, would be absolutely good when the full attainment\ncame, and the straining after right had been swallowed up in the\nperfect calm of settled virtue.\n\n'How also of the wise man tormented by pain, or in hunger and poverty\nand rags, is his perfectness of wisdom and goodness really sufficient\nto make him happy?'  Here, again, the answer had to be hesitating and\nprovisional, through no fault of the Stoics.  In this world, while we\nare still under the strange dominion of time and circumstance, the\nideal can never wholly fit the real.  There must still be difficulty\nand incompleteness here, only to be solved and perfected 'when iniquity\nshall have an end.'  Our eyes may fail with looking upward, yet the\nupward look is well; and the jibes upon the Stoic 'king in rags' that\nHorace and others were so fond of, do not affect the question.  It may\nhave been, and probably often was, the case that Stoic teachers {240}\nwere apt to transfer to themselves personally the ideal attributes,\nwhich they justly assigned to the ideal man in whom wisdom was\nperfected.  The doctrine gave much scope for cant and mental pride and\nhypocrisy, as every ideal doctrine does, including the Christian.  But\nthe existence of these vices in individuals no more affected the\ndoctrine of an ideal goodness in its Stoic form, than it does now in\nits Christian one.  That only the good man is truly wise or free or\nhappy; that vice, however lavishly it surround itself with luxury and\nease and power, is inherently wretched and foolish and slavish;--these\nare things which are worth saying and worth believing, things, indeed,\nwhich the world dare not and cannot permanently disbelieve, however\ndifficult or even impossible it may be to mark men off into two\nclasses, the good and the bad, however strange the irony of\ncircumstance which so often shows the wicked who 'are not troubled as\nother men, neither are they plagued like other men; they have more than\ntheir heart could wish,' while good men battle with adversity, often in\nvain.  Still will the permanent, fruitful, progressive faith of man\n'look to the end'; still will the ideal be powerful to plead for the\npainful right, and spoil, even in the tasting, the pleasant wrong.\n\nThe doctrine, of course, like every doctrine worth anything, was pushed\nto extravagant lengths, and {241} thrust into inappropriate quarters,\nby foolish doctrinaires.  As that the wise man is the only orator,\ncritic, poet, physician, nay, cobbler if you please; that the wise man\nknows all that is to be known, and can do everything that is worth\ndoing, and so on.  The school was often too academic, too abstract, too\nfond of hearing itself talk.  This, alas! is what most schools are, and\nmost schoolmasters.\n\nYet the Stoics were not altogether alien to the ordinary interests and\nduties of life.  They admitted a duty of co-operating in politics, at\nleast in such states as showed some desire for, or approach to, virtue.\nThey approved of the wise man taking part in education, of his marrying\nand bringing up children, both for his own sake and his country's.  He\nwill be ready even to 'withdraw himself from life on behalf of his\ncountry or his friends.  This 'withdrawal,' which was their word for\nsuicide, came unhappily to be much in the mouths of later, and\nespecially of the Roman, Stoics, who, in the sadness and restraint of\nprevailing despotism, came to thank God that no one was compelled to\nremain in life; he might 'withdraw' when the burden of life, the\nhopelessness of useful activity, became too great.\n\nWith this sad, stern, yet not undignified note, the philosophy of\nGreece speaks its last word.  The later scepticism of the New Academy,\ndirected mainly to a negative criticism of the crude enough logic of\nthe {242} Stoics, or of the extravagances of their ethical doctrine,\ncontributed no substantial element to thought or morals.  As an\neclectic system it had much vogue, side by side with Stoicism and\nEpicureanism, among the Romans, having as its chief exponent Cicero, as\nEpicureanism had Lucretius, and Stoicism, Seneca.\n\nThe common characteristic of all these systems in their later\ndevelopments, is their _cosmopolitanism_.  _Homo sum, nil humani a me\nalienum puto_, 'I am a man; nothing appertaining to humanity do I deem\nalien from myself,' this was the true keynote of whatever was vital in\nany of them.  And the reason of this is not far to seek.  We have seen\nalready (p. 82) how the chaos of sophistic doctrine was largely\nconditioned, if not produced, by the breakdown of the old civic life of\nGreece.  The process hardly suffered delay from all the efforts of\nSocrates and Plato.  Cosmopolitanism was already a point of union\nbetween the Cynics and Cyrenaics (see p. 128).  And the march of\npolitics was always tending in the same direction.  First through great\nleagues, such as the Spartan or Athenian or Theban, each with a\npredominant or tyrannical city at the head; then later through the\nconquest of Greece by Alexander, and the leaguing of all Greek-speaking\npeoples in the great invasion of Asia; then through the spread of Greek\nletters all over the Eastern {243} world, and the influx upon Greek\ncentres such as Athens and Alexandria, of all manner of foreign\nintelligences; and finally, through the conquest of all this teeming\nworld of culture by the discipline and practical ability of Rome, and\nits incorporation in a universal empire of law, all the barriers which\nhad divided city from city and tribe from tribe and race from race\ndisappeared, and only a common humanity remained.\n\nThe only effective philosophies for such a community were those which\nregarded man as an _individual_, with a world politically omnipotent\nhedging him about, and driving him in upon himself.  Thus the New\nAcademy enlarged on the doubtfulness of all beyond the individual\nconsciousness; Stoicism insisted on individual dutifulness,\nEpicureanism on individual self-satisfaction.  The first sought to make\nlife worth living through culture, the second through indifference, the\nthird through a moderate enjoyment.  But all alike felt themselves very\nhelpless in face of the growing sadness of life, in face of the\ndeepening mystery of the world beyond.  All alike were controversial,\nand quick enough to ridicule their rivals; none was hopefully\nconstructive, or (unless in the poetic enthusiasm of a Lucretius) very\nconfident of the adequacy of its own conceptions.  They all rather\nquickened the sense of emptiness in human existence, than satisfied it;\n{244} at the best they enabled men to \"absent themselves a little while\nfrom the felicity of death.\"\n\nThus all over the wide area of Greek and Roman civilisation, the\nactivity of the later schools was effectual to familiarise humanity\nwith the language of philosophy, and to convince humanity of the\ninadequacy of its results.  Both of these things the Greeks taught to\nSaul of Tarsus; at a higher Source he found the satisfying of his soul;\nbut from the Greek philosophies he learned the language through which\nthe new Revelation was to be taught in the great world of Roman rule\nand Grecian culture.  And thus through the Pauline theology, Greek\nphilosophy had its part in the moral regeneration of the world; as it\nhas had, in later times, in every emancipation and renascence of its\nthought.\n\n\n\n\n{245}\n"]
