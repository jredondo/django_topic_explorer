["CHAPTER XV\n\nPLATO (_continued_)\n\n_The Republic--Denizens of the cave--The Timaeus--A dream of creation_\n\n\nAnd now we pass to the central and crowning work of Plato, _The\nRepublic_, or _Of Justice_--the longest with one exception, and\ncertainly the greatest of all his works.  It combines the humour and\nirony, the vivid characterisation and lively dialogue of his earlier\nworks, with the larger and more serious view, the more constructive and\nstatesmanlike aims of his later life.  The dialogue opens very\nbeautifully.  There has been a festal procession at the Piraeus, the\nharbour of Athens, and Socrates with a companion is wending his way\nhomeward, when he is recalled by other companions, who induce him to\nvisit the house of an aged friend of his, Cephalus, whom he does not\nvisit too often.  Him he finds seated in his court, crowned, as the\ncustom was, for the celebration of a family sacrifice, and beholds\nbeaming on his face the peace of a life well spent and reconciled.\nThey talk of the happiness that comes in old age to those who have done\ngood and not evil, and who are not too severely {147} tried in the\nmatter of worldly cares.  Life to this good old man seems a very simple\nmatter; duty to God, duty to one's neighbours, each according to what\nis prescribed and orderly; this is all, and this is sufficient.\n\nThen comes in the questioning Socrates, with his doubts and\ndifficulties as to what is one's duty in special circumstances; and the\ndiscussion is taken up, not by the good old man, \"who goes away to the\nsacrifice,\" but by his son, who can quote the authorities; and by\nThrasymachus, the Sophist, who will have nothing to do with authority,\nbut maintains that _interest_ is the only real meaning of justice, and\nthat Might is Right.  Socrates, by analogy of the arts, shows that\nMight absolutely without tincture of justice is mere weakness, and that\nthere is honour even among thieves.  Yet the exhibition of the 'law\nworking in the members' seems to have its weak side so long as we look\nto individual men, in whom there are many conflicting influences, and\nmany personal chances and difficulties, which obscure the relation\nbetween just action and happiness.\n\nSocrates therefore will have justice 'writ large' in the community as a\nwhole, first pictured in its simpler, and then in its more complex and\nluxurious forms.  The relation of the individual to the community is\nrepresented chiefly as one of education and training; and many strange\ntheories--as of the equal {148} training of men and women, and the\ncommunity of wives, ideas partially drawn from Sparta--are woven into\nthe ideal structure.  Then the dialogue rises to a larger view of\neducation, as a preparation of the soul of man, not for a community on\nearth, but for that heavenly life which was suggested above (p. 144) in\nthe myth of the steeds.\n\nThe purely earthly unideal life is represented as a life of men tied\nneck and heels from birth in a cave, having their backs to the light,\nand their eyes fixed only on the shadows which are cast upon the wall.\nThese they take for the only realities, and they may acquire much skill\nin interpreting the shadows.  Turn these men suddenly to the true\nlight, and they will be dazzled and blinded.  They will feel as though\nthey had lost the realities, and been plunged into dreams.  And in pain\nand sorrow they will be tempted to grope back again to the familiar\ndarkness.\n\nYet if they hold on in patience, and struggle up the steep till the sun\nhimself breaks on their vision, what pain and dazzling once more, yet\nat the last what glorious revelation!  True, if they revisit their old\ndwelling-place, they will not see as well as their fellows who are\nstill living contentedly there, knowing nothing other than the shadows.\nThey may even seem to these as dreamers who have lost their senses; and\nshould they try to enlighten these denizens of the cave, they may be\npersecuted or {149} even put to death.  Such are the men who have had a\nsight of the heavenly verities, when compared with the children of\nearth and darkness.\n\nYet the world will never be right till those who have had this vision\ncome back to the things of earth and order them according to the\neternal verities; the philosopher must be king if ever the perfect life\nis to be lived on earth, either by individual or community.  As it\nwould be expressed in Scriptural language, \"The kingdoms of this world\nmust become the kingdoms of the Lord and of His Christ.\"\n\nFor the training of these ideal rulers an ideal education is required,\nwhich Plato calls dialectic; something of its nature is described later\non (p. 170), and we need not linger over it here.\n\nThe argument then seems to fall to a lower level.  There are various\napproximations in actual experience to the ideal community, each more\nor less perfect according to the degree in which the good of the\nindividual is also made the good of all, and the interests of governors\nand governed are alike.  Parallel with each lower form of state is a\nlower individual nature, the worst of all being that of the tyrant,\nwhose will is his only law, and his own self-indulgence his only\nmotive.  In him indeed Might is Right; but his life is the very\nantithesis of happiness.  Nay, pleasure of any kind can give no law to\nreason; reason can judge of pleasure, but not _vice vers\u00e2_.  There is\nno profit to a {150} man though he gain the whole world, if _himself_\nbe lost; if he become worse; if the better part of him be silenced and\ngrow weaker.  And after this 'fitful fever' is over, may there not be a\ngreater bliss beyond?  There have been stories told us, visions of\nanother world, where each man is rewarded according to his works.  And\nthe book closes with a magnificent Vision of Judgment.  It is the story\nof Er, son of Armenius, who being wounded in battle, after twelve days'\ntrance comes back to life, and tells of the judgment seat, of heavenly\nbliss and hellish punishments, and of the renewal of life and the new\nchoice given to souls not yet purified wholly of sin.  \"God is\nblameless; Man's Soul is immortal; Justice and Truth are the only\nthings eternally good.\"  Such is the final revelation.\n\nThe _Timaeus_ is an attempt by Plato, under the guise of a Pythagorean\nphilosopher, to image forth as in a vision or dream the actual framing\nof the universe, conceived as a realisation of the Eternal Thought or\nIdea.  It will be remembered that in the analysis already given (p.\n143) of the process of knowledge in individual men, Plato found that\nprior to the suggestions of the senses, though not coming into\nconsciousness except in connection with sensation, men had _ideas_ that\ngave them a power of rendering their sensations intelligible.  In the\n_Timaeus_ Plato attempts a vision of the universe as though he saw\n{151} it working itself into actuality on the lines of those ideas.\nThe vision is briefly as follows: There is the Eternal Creator, who\ndesired to make the world because He was good and free from jealousy,\nand therefore willed that all things should be like Himself; that is,\nthat the formless, chaotic, unrealised void might receive form and\norder, and become, in short, real as He was.  Thus creation is the\nprocess by which the Eternal Creator works out His own image, His own\nideas, in and through that which is formless, that which has no name,\nwhich is nothing but possibility,--dead earth, namely, or _Matter_.\nAnd first the world-soul, image of the divine, is formed, on which as\non a \"diamond network\" the manifold structure of things is\nfashioned--the stars, the seven planets with their sphere-music, the\nfour elements, and all the various creatures, aetherial or fiery,\naerial, aqueous, and earthy, with the consummation of them all in\nmicrocosm, in the animal world, and specially in man.\n\nOne can easily see that this is an attempt by Plato to carry out the\nreverse process in thought to that which first comes to thinking man.\nMan has sensations, that is, he comes first upon that which is\nconceivably last in creation, on the immediate and temporary things or\nmomentary occurrences of earth.  In these sensations, as they\naccumulate into a kind of habitual or unreasoned knowledge or opinion,\nhe discovers elements which have been active to {152} correlate the\nsensations, which have from the first exercised a governing influence\nupon the sensations, without which, indeed, no two sensations could be\nbrought together to form anything one could name.  These regulative,\nunderlying, permanent elements are Ideas, _i.e._ General Forms or\nNotions, which, although they may come second as regards time into\nconsciousness, are by reason known to have been there before, because\nthrough them alone can the sensations become intelligibly possible, or\nthinkable, or namable.  Thus Plato is led to the conception of an order\nthe reverse of our individual experience, the order of creation, the\norder of God's thought, which is equivalent to the order of God's\nworking; for God's thought and God's working are inseparable.\n\nOf course Plato, in working out his dream of creation absolutely\nwithout any scientific knowledge, the further he travels the more\nobviously falls into confusion and absurdity; where he touches on some\nideas having a certain resemblance to modern scientific discoveries, as\nthe law of gravitation, the circulation of the blood, the quantitative\nbasis of differences of quality, etc., these happy guesses are apt to\nlead more frequently wrong than right, because they are not kept in\ncheck by any experimental tests.  But taken as a 'myth,' which is\nperhaps all that Plato intended, the work offers much that is\nprofoundly interesting.\n\n{153}\n\nWith the _Timaeus_ is associated another dialogue called the _Critias_,\nwhich remains only as a fragment.  In it is contained a description of\nthe celebrated visionary kingdom of Atlantis, lying far beyond the\npillars of Hercules, a land of splendour and luxury and power, a land\nalso of gentle manners and wise orderliness.  \"The fiction has\nexercised a great influence over the imagination of later ages.  As\nmany attempts have been made to find the great island as to discover\nthe country of the lost tribes.  Without regard to the description of\nPlato, and without a suspicion that the whole narrative is a\nfabrication, interpreters have looked for the spot in every part of the\nglobe--America, Palestine, Arabia Felix, Ceylon, Sardinia, Sweden.  The\nstory had also an effect on the early navigators of the sixteenth\ncentury\" (Jowett, _Plato_, vol. iii. p. 679).\n\n\n\n\n{154}\n"]
