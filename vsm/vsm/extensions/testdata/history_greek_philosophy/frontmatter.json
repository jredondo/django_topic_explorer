EDIN.\n\n\nRECTOR OF THE ROYAL HIGH SCHOOL, EDINBURGH\n\nFORMERLY PROFESSOR OF CLASSICAL LITERATURE AND PHILOSOPHY\n\nIN THE YORKSHIRE COLLEGE, LEEDS\n\n\n\n\nLONDON\n\nPERCIVAL AND CO.\n\n1891\n\n_All rights reserved_\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nThe main purpose which I have had in view in writing this book has been\nto present an account of Greek philosophy which, within strict limits\nof brevity, shall be at once authentic and interesting--_authentic_, as\nbeing based on the original works themselves, and not on any secondary\nsources; _interesting_, as presenting to the ordinary English reader,\nin language freed as far as possible from technicality and\nabstruseness, the great thoughts of the greatest men of antiquity on\nquestions of permanent significance and value.  There has been no\nattempt to shirk the really philosophic problems which these men tried\nin their day to solve; but I have endeavoured to show, by a sympathetic\ntreatment of them, that these problems were no mere wars of words, but\nthat in fact the philosophers of twenty-four centuries ago were dealing\nwith exactly similar difficulties as to the bases of belief and of\nright action as, under different forms, beset thoughtful men and women\nto-day.\n\nIn the general treatment of the subject, I have followed in the main\nthe order, and drawn chiefly on the selection of passages, in Ritter\nand Preller's _Historia Philosophiae Graecae_.  It is hoped that in\nthis way the little book may be found useful at the universities, as a\nrunning commentary on that excellent work; and the better to aid\nstudents in the use of it for that purpose, the corresponding sections\nin Ritter and Preller are indicated by the figures in the margin.\n\nIn the sections on Plato, and occasionally elsewhere, I have drawn to\nsome extent, by the kind permission of the Delegates of the Clarendon\nPress and his own, on Professor Jowett's great commentary and\ntranslation.\n\nJOHN MARSHALL.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's notes:\n\nThe passage numbers in the Ritter-Preller book mentioned in the second\nparagraph above are indicated in this book with square brackets, e.g.\n\"[10]\".  In the original book they were formatted as sidenotes.  In\nthis e-book they are embedded in the text approximately where they\nappear in the original book, unless they are at the start of a\nparagraph, in which case they appear immediately before that paragraph.\n\nPage numbers are indicated with curly brackets, e.g. \"{5}\".  They are\nembedded into the text where page breaks occurred in the original book.\n\nIn the original book, pages had headings that varied with the material\nbeing discussed on that pair of pages.  In this e-book, those headings\nhave been collected into an \"introductory\" paragraph at the beginning\nof each chapter.\n\n\nThe original book uses several Greek words.  These words, the chapters\nthey are used in, and their transliterations are as follows:\n\nChapter I (pages 3, 4, 12) - \"arche\" - alpha (with the soft-breathing\nmark), rho, chi, eta; \"phloios\" - phi, lambda, omicron, iota, omicron,\nfinal sigma.\n\nChapter III (page 28) - \"soma\" - sigma, omega, mu, alpha; \"sema\" -\nsigma, eta, mu, alpha.\n\nChapter IV (page 33, 34 - \"doxa\" - delta, omicron, xi, alpha; \"Peri\" -\nPI, epsilon, rho, iota; \"Phueos\" - PHI, upsilon, sigma, epsilon, omega,\nfinal sigma.\n\nChapter V (page 48) - \"logos\" - lambda, omicron, gamma, omicron, final\nsigma; \"hule\" - upsilon with rough breathing mark, lambda, eta.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nCHAP.\n\n     I.--THE SCHOOL OF MILETUS--\n            I.
