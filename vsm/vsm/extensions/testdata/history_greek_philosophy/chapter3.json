["CHAPTER III\n\nPYTHAGORAS AND THE PYTHAGOREANS\n\n_The Pythagorean Brotherhood--Number the master--God the soul of the\nworld--Music and morals_\n\n\n[41]\n\nThe birthplace of Pythagoras is uncertain.  He is generally called the\nSamian, and we know, at all events, that he lived for some time in that\nisland, during or immediately before the famous tyranny [43] of\nPolycrates.  All manner of legends are told of the travels of\nPythagoras to Egypt, Chaldaea, Phoenicia, and even to India.  Others\ntell of a mysterious initiation at the sacred cave of Jupiter in Crete,\nand of a similar ceremony at the Delphic oracle.  What is certain is\nthat at some date towards the end of the sixth century B.C. he removed\nto Southern Italy, which was then extensively colonised by Greeks, and\nthat there he became a great philosophic teacher, and ultimately even a\npredominating political influence.\n\n[46]\n\nHe instituted a school in the strictest sense, with its various grades\nof learners, subject for years to a vow of silence, holding all things\nin common, and admitted, according to their approved fitness, to {23}\n[47] successive revelations of the true doctrine of the Master.  Those\nin the lower grades were called Listeners; those in the higher,\nMathematicians or Students; those in the most advanced stage,\nPhysicists or Philosophers.  With the political relations of the school\nwe need not here concern ourselves.  In Crotona and many other Greek\ncities in Italy Pythagoreans became a predominant aristocracy, who,\nhaving learned obedience under their master, applied what they had\nlearned in an anti-democratic policy of government.  This lasted for\nsome thirty years, but ultimately democracy gained the day, and\nPythagoreanism as a political power was violently rooted out.\n\nReturning to the philosophy of Pythagoras, in its relation to the\ngeneral development of Greek theory, we may note, to begin with, that\nit is not necessary, or perhaps possible, to disentangle the theory of\nPythagoras himself from that of his followers, Philolaus and others.\nThe teaching was largely oral, and was developed by successive leaders\nof the school.  The doctrine, therefore, is generally spoken of as\nthat, not of Pythagoras, but of the Pythagoreans.  Nor can we fix for\ncertain on one fundamental conception, upon which the whole structure\nof their doctrine was built.\n\n[52]\n\nOne dictum we may start with because of its analogies with what has\nbeen said of the earlier {24} philosophies.  The universe, said the\nPythagoreans, was constituted of _indefinites_ and _definers_, _i.e._\nof that which has no character, but has infinite capacities of taking a\ncharacter; and secondly, of things or forces which impose a character\nupon this.  Out of the combination of these two elements or principles\nall knowable [53] existences come into being.  \"All things,\" they said,\n\"as known have _Number_; and this number has two natures, the Odd and\nthe Even; the known thing is the Odd-Even or union of the two.\"\n\n[66]\n\nBy a curious and somewhat fanciful development of this conception the\nPythagoreans drew up two parallel columns of antithetical principles in\nnature, ten in each, thus:--\n\n  Definite              Indefinite\n  Odd                   Even\n  One                   Many\n  Right                 Left\n  Male                  Female\n  Steadfast             Moving\n  Straight              Bent\n  Light                 Dark\n  Good                  Evil\n  Four Square           Irregular\n\nLooking down these two lists we shall see that the first covers various\naspects of what is conceived as the ordering, defining, formative\nprinciple in nature; and that the second in like manner comprises\nvarious {25} aspects of the unordered, neutral, passive, or\ndisorganised element or principle; the first, to adopt a later method\nof expression, is _Form_, the second _Matter_.  How this antithesis was\nworked out by Plato and Aristotle we shall see later on.\n\n[54]\n\nWhile, in a sense, then, even the indefinite has number, inasmuch as it\nis capable of having number or order imposed upon it (and only in so\nfar as it has this imposed upon it, does it become knowable or\nintelligible), yet, as a positive factor, Number belongs only to the\nfirst class; as such it is the source of all knowledge and of all good.\nIn reality the Pythagoreans had not got any further by this\nrepresentation of nature than was reached, for example, by Anaximander,\nand still more definitely by Heraclitus, when they posited an\nIndefinite or Infinite principle in nature which by the clash of innate\nantagonisms developed into a knowable universe (see above, pp. 12, 16).\nBut one can easily imagine that once the idea of Number became\nassociated with that of the knowable in things, a wide field of\ndetailed development and experiment, so to speak, in the arcana of\nnature, seemed to be opened.  Every arithmetical or geometrical theorem\nbecame in this view another window giving light into the secret heart\nof things.  Number became a kind of god, a revealer; and the philosophy\nof number a kind of religion or mystery.  And this is why the {26}\nsecond grade of disciples were called Mathematicians; mathematics was\nthe essential preparation for and initiation into philosophy.\n\nWhether that which truly exists was actually identical with Number or\nNumbers, or whether it was something different from Number, but had a\ncertain relation to Number; whether if there were such a relation, this\nwas merely a relation of analogy or of conformability, or whether\nNumber were something actually embodied in that which truly\nexists--these were speculative questions which were variously answered\nby various teachers, and which probably interested the later more than\nthe earlier leaders of the school.\n\n[56]\n\nA further question arose: Assuming that ultimately the elements of\nknowable existence are but two, the One or Definite, and the Manifold\nor Indefinite, it was argued by some that there must be some third or\nhigher principle governing the relations of these; there must be some\nlaw or harmony which shall render their intelligible union [57]\npossible.  This principle of union was God, ever-living, ever One,\neternal, immovable, self-identical.  [58] This was the supreme reality,\nthe Odd-Even or Many in One, One in Many, in whom was gathered up, as\nin an eternal harmony, all the contrarieties of lower [61] existence.\nThrough the interchange and intergrowth of these contrarieties God\nrealises Himself; the {27} universe in its evolution is the\nself-picturing of God.  [62] God is diffused as the seminal principle\nthroughout [68] the universe; He is the Soul of the world, and the\nworld itself is God in process.  The world, therefore, is in a sense a\nliving creature.  At its heart and circumference are purest fire;\nbetween these circle the sun, the moon, and the five planets, whose\nordered movements, as of seven chords, produce an eternal music, the\n'Music of the Spheres.'  Earth, too, like the planets, is a celestial\nbody, moving like them around the central fire.\n\n[71]\n\nBy analogy with this conception of the universe as the realisation of\nGod, so also the body, whether [72] of man or of any creature, is the\nrealisation for the time being of a soul.  Without the body and the\nlife of the body, that soul were a blind and fleeting ghost.  Of such\nunrealised souls there are many in various degrees and states; the\nwhole air indeed is full of spirits, who are the causes of dreams and\nomens.\n\n[73]\n\nThus the change and flux that are visible in all else are visible also\nin the relations of soul and body.  Multitudes of fleeting ghosts or\nspirits are continually seeking realisation through union with bodies,\npassing at birth into this one and that, and at death issuing forth\nagain into the void.  Like wax which takes now one impression now\nanother, yet remains in itself ever the same, so souls vary in the\noutward {28} [74] form that envelops and realises them.  In this bodily\nlife, the Pythagoreans are elsewhere described as saying, we are as it\nwere in bonds or in a prison, whence we may not justly go forth till\nthe Lord calls us.  This idea Cicero mistranslated with a truly Roman\nfitness: according to him they taught that in this life we are as\nsentinels at our post, who may not quit it till our Commander orders.\n\nOn the one hand, therefore, the union of soul with body was necessary\nfor the realisation of the former ((Greek) _soma, body_, being as it\nwere (Greek) _sema, expression_), even as the reality of God was not in\nthe Odd or Eternal Unity, but in the Odd-Even, the Unity in\nMultiplicity.  On the other hand this union implied a certain loss or\ndegradation.  In other words, in so far as the soul became realised it\nalso became corporealised, subject to the influence of passion and [75]\nchange.  In a sense therefore the soul as realised was double; in\nitself it partook of the eternal reason, as associated with body it\nbelonged to the realm of unreason.\n\nThis disruption of the soul into two the Pythagoreans naturally\ndeveloped in time into a threefold division, _pure thought_,\n_perception_, and _desire_; or even more nearly approaching the\nPlatonic division (see below, p. 169), they divided it into _reason_,\n_passion_, and _desire_.  But the later developments were largely\ninfluenced by Platonic and other doctrines, and need not be further\nfollowed here.\n\n{29} [78] Music had great attractions for Pythagoras, not only for its\nsoothing and refining effects, but for the intellectual interest of its\nnumerical relations.  Reference has already been made (see above, p.\n27) to their quaint doctrine of the music of the spheres; and the same\nidea of rhythmic harmony pervaded the whole system.  The life of the\nsoul was a harmony; the virtues were perfect numbers; and the influence\nof music on the soul was only one instance among many of the harmonious\nrelations of things throughout the universe.  Thus we have Pythagoras\ndescribed as soothing mental afflictions, and bodily ones also, by\nrhythmic measure and by song.  With the morning's dawn he would be\nastir, harmonising his own spirit to his lyre, and chanting ancient\nhymns of the Cretan Thales, of Homer, and of Hesiod, till all the\ntremors of his soul were calmed and still.\n\nNight and morning also he prescribed for himself and his followers an\nexamination, as it were a _tuning_ and testing of oneself.  At these\ntimes especially was it meet for us to take account of our soul and its\ndoings; in the evening to ask, \"Wherein have I transgressed?  What\ndone?  What failed to do?\"  In the morning, \"What must I do?  Wherein\nrepair past days' forgetfulness?\"\n\nBut the first duty of all was truth,--truth to one's own highest, truth\nto the highest beyond us.  Through truth alone could the soul approach\nthe divine.  {30} Falsehood was of the earth; the real life of the soul\nmust be in harmony with the heavenly and eternal verities.\n\nPythagoreanism remained a power for centuries throughout the Greek\nworld and beyond.  All subsequent philosophies borrowed from it, as it\nin its later developments borrowed from them; and thus along with them\nit formed the mind of the world, for further apprehensions, and yet\nmore authentic revelations, of divine order and moral excellence.\n\n\n\n\n{31}\n"]
