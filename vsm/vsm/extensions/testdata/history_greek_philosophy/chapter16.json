["CHAPTER XVI\n\nPLATO (_continued_)\n\n_Metaphysics and psychology--Reason and pleasure--Criticism of the\nideas--Last ideals_\n\n\nWe now come to a series of highly important dialogues, marked as a\nwhole by a certain diminution in the purely artistic attraction, having\nless of vivid characterisation, less humour, less dramatic interest,\nless perfect construction in every way, but, on the other hand,\npeculiarly interesting as presenting a kind of after-criticism of his\nown philosophy.  In them Plato brings his philosophic conceptions into\nstriking relation with earlier or rival theories such as the Eleatic,\nthe Megarian, the Cyrenaic, and the Cynic, and touches in these\nconnections on many problems of deep and permanent import.\n\nThe most remarkable feature in these later dialogues is the\ndisappearance, or even in some cases the apparently hostile criticism,\nof the doctrine of Ideas, and consequently of Reminiscence as the\nsource of knowledge, and even, apparently, of Personal {155}\nImmortality, so far as the doctrine of Reminiscence was imagined to\nguarantee it.  This, however, is perhaps to push the change of view too\nfar.  We may say that Plato in these dialogues is rather the\npsychologist than the metaphysician; he is attempting a revised\nanalysis of mental processes.  From this point of view it was quite\nintelligible that he should discover difficulties in his former theory\nof our mental relation to the external reality, without therefore\nseeing reason to doubt the existence of that reality.  The position is\nsomewhat similar to that of a modern philosopher who attempts to think\nout the psychological problem of Human Will in relation to Almighty and\nOver-ruling Providence.  One may very clearly see the psychological\ndifficulties, without ceasing to believe either in the one or the other\nas facts.\n\nThroughout Plato's philosophy, amidst every variation of expression, we\nmay take these three as practically fixed points of belief or of faith,\nor at least of hope; _first_, that Mind is eternally master of the\nuniverse; _second_, that Man in realising what is most truly himself is\nworking in harmony with the Eternal Mind, and is in this way a master\nof nature, reason governing experience and not being a product of\nexperience; and _thirdly_ (as Socrates said before his judges), that at\ndeath we go to powers who are wise and good, and to men departed who in\ntheir day shared in the divine wisdom and goodness,--that, in short,\nthere is something remaining for the dead, and better for those that\nhave done good than for those that have done evil.\n\nThe first of the 'psychological dialogues,' as we have called them, is\nthe _Philebus_.  The question here is of the _summum bonum_ or chief\ngood.  What is it?  Is it pleasure?  Is it wisdom?  Or is it both?  In\nthe process of answering these questions Plato lays down rules for true\ndefinition, and establishes classifications which had an immense\ninfluence on his successor Aristotle, but which need not be further\nreferred to here.\n\nThe general gist of the argument is as follows.  Pleasure could not be\nregarded as a sufficient or perfect good if it was entirely emptied of\nthe purely intellectual elements of anticipation and consciousness and\nmemory.  This would be no better than the pleasure of an oyster.  On\nthe other hand, a purely intellectual existence can hardly be regarded\nas perfect and sufficient either.  The perfect life must be a union of\nboth.\n\nBut this union must be an orderly and rational union; in other words,\nit must be one in which Mind is master and Pleasure servant; the\nfinite, the regular, the universal must govern the indefinite,\nvariable, particular.  Thus in the perfect life there are four\nelements; in the body, earth, water, air, fire; in the soul, the\nfinite, the indefinite, the union of the {157} two, and the cause of\nthat union.  If this be so, he argues, may we not by analogy argue for\na like four-fold order in the universe?  There also we find regulative\nelements, and indefinite elements, and the union of the two.  Must\nthere not also be the Great Cause, even Divine Wisdom, ordering and\ngoverning all things?\n\nThe second of the psychological series is the _Parmenides_, in which\nthe great Eleatic philosopher, in company with his disciple Zeno, is\nimagined instructing the youthful Socrates when the two were on a visit\nto Athens, which may or may not be historical (see above, p. 34).  The\nmost striking portion of this dialogue is the criticism already alluded\nto of Plato's own theory of Ideas, put into the mouth of Parmenides.\nParmenides ascertains from Socrates that he is quite clear about there\nbeing Ideas of Justice, Beauty, Goodness, eternally existing, but how\nabout Ideas of such common things as hair, mud, filth, etc.?  Socrates\nis not so sure; to which Parmenides rejoins that as he grows older\nphilosophy will take a surer hold of him, and that he will recognise\nthe same law in small things and in great.\n\nBut now as to the nature of these Ideas.  What, Parmenides asks, is the\nrelation of these, as eternally existing in the mind of God, to the\nsame ideas as possessed by individual men?  Does each individual\nactually _partake_ in the thought of God through {158} the ideas, or\nare his ideas only _resemblances_ of the eternal?  If he partakes, then\nthe eternal ideas are not one but many, as many as the persons who\npossess them.  If his ideas only resemble, then there must be some\nbasis of reference by which the resemblance is established, a _tertium\nquid_ or third existence resembling both, and so _ad infinitum_.\nSocrates is puzzled by this, and suggests that perhaps the Ideas are\nonly notions in our minds.  But to this it is replied that there is an\nend in that case of any reality in our ideas.  Unless in some way they\nhave a true and causal relation with something beyond our minds, there\nis an end of mind altogether, and with mind gone everything goes.\n\nThis, as Professor Jowett remarks, \"remains a difficulty for us as well\nas for the Greeks of the fourth century before Christ, and is the\nstumbling-block of Kant's _Critic_, and of the Hamiltonian adaptation\nof Kant as well as of the Platonic ideas.  It has been said that 'you\ncannot criticise Revelation.'  'Then how do you know what is\nRevelation, or that there is one at all?' is the immediate rejoinder.\n'You know nothing of things in themselves.'--'Then how do you know that\nthere are things in themselves?'  In some respects the difficulty\npressed harder upon the Greek than upon ourselves.  For conceiving of\nGod more under the attribute of knowledge than we do, he was more under\nthe necessity of {159} separating the divine from the human, as two\nspheres which had no communication with one another.\"\n\nNext follows an extraordinary analysis of the ideas of 'Being' and\n'Unity,' remarkable not only for its subtlety, but for the relation\nwhich it historically bears to the modern philosophic system of Hegel.\n\"Every affirmation is _ipso facto_ a negation;\" \"the negation of a\nnegation is an affirmation;\" these are the psychological (if not\nmetaphysical) facts, on which the analysis of Parmenides and the\nphilosophy of Hegel are both founded.\n\nWe may pass more rapidly by the succeeding dialogues of the series: the\n_Theaetetus_ (already quoted from above, p. 89), which is a close and\npowerful investigation of the nature of knowledge on familiar Platonic\nlines; the _Sophist_, which is an analysis of fallacious reasoning; and\nthe _Statesman_, which, under the guise of a dialectical search for the\ntrue ruler of men, represents once more Plato's ideal of government,\nand contrasts this with the ignorance and charlatanism of actual\npolitics.\n\nIn relation to subsequent psychology, and more particularly to the\nlogical system of Aristotle, these dialogues are extremely important.\nWe may indeed say that the systematic logic of Aristotle, as contained\nin the _Organon_, is little more than an abstract {160} or digest of\nthe logical theses of these dialogues.  Definition and division, the\nnature and principle of classification, the theory of predication, the\nprocesses of induction and deduction, the classification and criticism\nof fallacies,--all these are to be found in them.  The only addition\nreally made by Aristotle was the systematic theory of the syllogism.\n\nThe _Laws_, the longest of Plato's works, seems to have been composed\nby him in the latest years of his long life, and was probably not\npublished till after his death.  It bears traces of its later origin in\nthe less artful juncture of its parts, in the absence of humour, in the\ngreater overloading of details, in the less graphic and appropriate\ncharacterisation of the speakers.  These speakers are three--an\nAthenian, a Cretan, and a Spartan.  A new colony is to be led forth\nfrom Crete, and the Cretan takes advice of the others as to the\nordering of the new commonwealth.  We are no longer, as in _The\nRepublic_, in an ideal world, a city coming down from, or set in, the\nheavens.  There is no longer a perfect community; nor are philosophers\nto be its kings.  Laws more or less similar to those of Sparta fill\nabout half the book.  But the old spirit of obedience and\nself-sacrifice and community is not forgotten; and on all men and\nwomen, noble and humble alike, the duty is cast, to bear in common the\ncommon burden of life.\n\n{161}\n\nThus, somewhat in sadness and decay, yet with a dignity and moral\ngrandeur not unworthy of his life's high argument, the great procession\nof the Ideal Philosopher's dialogues closes.\n\n\n\n\n{162}\n"]
