["CHAPTER XIV\n\nPLATO\n\n_Student and wanderer--The Dialogues--Immortal longings--Art is\nlove--Knowledge through remembrance--Platonic love_\n\n\n[239]\n\nThis great master, the Shakespeare of Greek philosophy, as one may call\nhim, for his fertility, his variety, his humour, his imagination, his\npoetic grace, was born at Athens in the year 429 B.C.  He was of noble\nfamily, numbering among his ancestors no less a man than the great\nlawgiver Solon, and tracing back his descent even further to the [240]\nlegendary Codrus, last king of Athens.  At a very early age he seems to\nhave begun to study the philosophers, Heraclitus more particularly, and\nbefore he was twenty he had written a tragedy.  About that time,\nhowever, he met Socrates; and at once giving up all thought of poetic\nfame he burnt his poem, and devoted himself to the hearing of Socrates.\nFor ten years he was his constant companion.  When Socrates met his\ndeath in 399, Plato and other followers of the master fled at first to\nMegara, as already mentioned (above, p. 132); he then entered on a\nperiod of extended travel, first to Cyrene and {135} Egypt, thence to\nItaly and Sicily.  In Italy he devoted himself specially to a study of\nthe doctrine of Pythagoras.  It is said that at Syracuse he offended\nthe tyrant Dionysius the elder by his freedom of speech, and was\ndelivered up to the Spartans, who were then at war with Athens.  [241]\nUltimately he was ransomed, and found his way back to Athens, but he is\nsaid to have paid a second visit to Sicily when the younger Dionysius\nbecame tyrant.  He seems to have entertained the hope that he might so\ninfluence this young man as to be able to realise through him the dream\nof his life, a government in accordance with the dictates of [242]\nphilosophy.  His dream, however, was disappointed of fruition, and he\nreturned to Athens, there in the 'groves of Academus' a mythic hero of\nAthens, to spend the rest of his days in converse with his followers,\nand there at the ripe age of eighty-one he died.  From the scene of his\nlabours his philosophy has ever since been known as the Academic [243]\nphilosophy.  Unlike Socrates, he was not content to leave only a memory\nof himself and his conversations.  He was unwearied in the redaction\nand correction of his written dialogues, altering them here and there\nboth in expression and in structure.  It is impossible, therefore, to\nbe absolutely certain as to the historical order of composition or\npublication among his numerous {136} dialogues, but a certain\napproximate order may be fixed.\n\nWe may take first a certain number of comparatively short dialogues,\nwhich are strongly Socratic in the following respects: _first_, they\neach seek a definition of some particular virtue or quality; _second_,\neach suggests some relation between it and knowledge; _third_, each\nleaves the answer somewhat open, treating the matter suggestively\nrather than dogmatically.  These dialogues are _Charmides_, which\ntreats of Temperance (_mens sana in corpore sano_); _Lysis_, which\ntreats of Friendship; _Laches_, Of Courage; _Ion_, Of Poetic\nInspiration; _Meno_, Of the teachableness of Virtue; _Euthyphro_, Of\nPiety.\n\nThe last of these may be regarded as marking a transition to a second\nseries, which are concerned with the trial and death of Socrates.  The\n_Euthyphro_ opens with an allusion by Socrates to his approaching\ntrial, and in the _Apology_ we have a Platonic version of Socrates'\nspeech in his own defence; in _Crito_ we have the story of his noble\nself-abnegation and civic obedience after his condemnation; in _Phaedo_\nwe have his last conversation with his friends on the subject of\nImmortality, and the story of his death.\n\nAnother series of the dialogues may be formed of those, more or less\nsatirical, in which the ideas and methods of the Sophists are\ncriticised: _Protagoras_, {137} in which Socrates suggests that all\nvirtues are essentially one; _Euthydemus_, in which the assumption and\n'airs' of some of the Sophists are made fun of; _Cratylus_, Of the\nsophistic use of words; _Gorgias_, Of the True and the False, the truly\nGood and the truly Evil; _Hippias_, Of Voluntary and Involuntary Sin;\n_Alcibiades_, Of Self-Knowledge; _Menexenus_, a (possibly ironical) set\noration after the manner of the Sophists, in praise of Athens.\n\nThe whole of this third series are characterised by humour, dramatic\ninterest, variety of personal type among the speakers, keenness rather\nthan depth of philosophic insight.  There are many suggestions of\nprofounder thoughts, afterwards worked out more fully; but on the whole\nthese dialogues rather stimulate thought than satisfy it; the great\npoet-thinker is still playing with his tools.\n\nA higher stage is reached in the _Symposium_, which deals at once\nhumorously and profoundly with the subject of Love, human and divine,\nand its relations to Art and Philosophy, the whole consummated in a\nspeech related by Socrates as having been spoken to him by Diotima, a\nwise woman of Mantineia.  From this speech an extract as translated by\nProfessor Jowett may be quoted here.  It marks the transition point\nfrom the merely playful and critical to the relatively serious and\ndogmatic stage in the mind of Plato:--\n\n{138} \"Marvel not,\" she said, \"if you believe that love is of the\nimmortal, as we have already several times acknowledged; for here\nagain, and on the same principle too, the mortal nature is seeking as\nfar as is possible to be everlasting and immortal: and this is only to\nbe attained by generation, because generation always leaves behind a\nnew existence in the place of the old.  Nay even in the life of the\nsame individual there is succession and not absolute unity: a man is\ncalled the same, and yet in the short interval which elapses between\nyouth and age, and in which every animal is said to have life and\nidentity, he is undergoing a perpetual process of loss and\nreparation--hair, flesh, bones, blood, and the whole body are always\nchanging.  Which is true not only of the body, but also of the soul,\nwhose habits, tempers, opinions, desires, pleasures, pains, fears,\nnever remain the same in any one of us, but are always coming and\ngoing; and equally true of knowledge, which is still more\nsurprising--for not only do the sciences in general come and go, so\nthat in respect of them we are never the same; but each of them\nindividually experiences a like change.  For what is implied in the\nword 'recollection,' but the departure of knowledge, which is ever\nbeing forgotten and is renewed and preserved by recollection, and\nappears to be the same although in reality new, according to that law\nof succession by which all mortal things are preserved, not absolutely\nthe same, but by substitution, the old worn-out mortality leaving\nanother new and similar existence behind--unlike the divine, which is\nalways the same and not another?  And in this way, Socrates, the mortal\nbody, or mortal anything, partakes of immortality; but the immortal in\nanother way.  Marvel not then at the love which all men have of their\noffspring; for that universal love and interest is for the sake of\nimmortality.\"\n\nI was astonished at her words, and said: \"Is this really true, O thou\nwise Diotima?\"  And she answered with all the authority of a sophist:\n\"Of that, Socrates, you may be assured;--think only of the ambition of\nmen, and you will wonder at the senselessness of their ways, unless you\nconsider how they are stirred by the love of an immortality of fame.\nThey are ready to run risks greater far than they would have run for\ntheir children, and to spend money and undergo any sort of {139} toil,\nand even to die for the sake of leaving behind them a name which shall\nbe eternal.  Do you imagine that Alcestis would have died to save\nAdmetus, or Achilles to avenge Patroclus, or your own Codrus in order\nto preserve the kingdom for his sons, if they had not imagined that the\nmemory of their virtues, which is still retained among us, would be\nimmortal?  Nay,\" she said, \"I am persuaded that all men do all things,\nand the better they are the more they do them, in hope of the glorious\nfame of immortal virtue; for they desire the immortal.\n\n\"They whose bodies only are creative, betake themselves to women and\nbeget children--this is the character of their love; their offspring,\nas they hope, will preserve their memory and give them the blessedness\nand immortality which they desire in the future.  But creative\nsouls--for there certainly are men who are more creative in their souls\nthan in their bodies--conceive that which is proper for the soul to\nconceive or retain.  And what are these conceptions?--wisdom and virtue\nin general.  And such creators are poets and all artists who are\ndeserving of the name inventor.  But the greatest and fairest sort of\nwisdom by far is that which is concerned with the ordering of states\nand families, and which is called temperance and justice.  And he who\nin youth has the seed of these implanted in him and is himself\ninspired, when he comes to maturity desires to beget and generate.  He\nwanders about seeking beauty that he may beget offspring--for in\ndeformity he will beget nothing--and naturally embraces the beautiful\nrather than the deformed body; above all when he finds a fair and noble\nand well-nurtured soul, he embraces the two in one person, and to such\nan one he is full of speech about virtue and the nature and pursuits of\na good man; and he tries to educate him; and at the touch of the\nbeautiful which is ever present to his memory, even when absent, he\nbrings forth that which he had conceived long before, and in company\nwith him tends that which he brings forth; and they are married by a\nfar nearer tie and have a closer friendship than those who beget mortal\nchildren, for the children who are their common offspring are fairer\nand more immortal.  Who, when he thinks of Homer and Hesiod and other\ngreat poets, {140} would not rather have their children than ordinary\nhuman ones?  Who would not emulate them in the creation of children\nsuch as theirs, which have preserved their memory and given them\neverlasting glory?  Or who would not have such children as Lycurgus\nleft behind him to be the saviours, not only of Lacedaemon, but of\nHellas, as one may say?  There is Solon, too, who is the revered father\nof Athenian laws; and many others there are in many other places, both\namong Hellenes and barbarians.  All of them have given to the world\nmany noble works, and have been the parents of virtue of every kind,\nand many temples have been raised in their honour for the sake of their\nchildren; which were never raised in honour of any one, for the sake of\nhis mortal children.\n\n\"These are the lesser mysteries of love, into which even you, Socrates,\nmay enter; to the greater and more hidden ones which are the crown of\nthese, and to which, if you pursue them in a right spirit, they will\nlead, I know not whether you will be able to attain.  But I will do my\nutmost to inform you, and do you follow if you can.  For he who would\nproceed aright in this matter should begin in youth to visit beautiful\nforms; and first, if he be guided by his instructor aright, to love one\nsuch form only--out of that he should create fair thoughts; and soon he\nwill of himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the\nbeauty of another; and then if beauty of form in general is his\npursuit, how foolish would he be not to recognise that the beauty in\nevery form is one and the same!  And when he perceives this he will\nabate his violent love of the one, which he will despise and deem a\nsmall thing, and will become a lover of all beautiful forms; in the\nnext stage he will consider that the beauty of the mind is more\nhonourable than the beauty of the outward form.  So that if a virtuous\nsoul have but a little comeliness, he will be content to love and tend\nhim, and will search out and bring to the birth thoughts which may\nimprove the young, until he is compelled to contemplate and see the\nbeauty of institutions and laws, and to understand that the beauty of\nthem all is of one family, and that personal beauty is a trifle; and\nafter laws and institutions he will go on to the sciences, that he may\nsee their beauty, being not like a servant in love with the beauty of\none youth or man or {141} institution, himself a slave mean and\nnarrow-minded, but drawing towards and contemplating the vast sea of\nbeauty, he will create many fair and noble thoughts and notions in\nboundless love of wisdom; until on that shore he grows and waxes\nstrong, and at last the vision is revealed to him of a single science,\nwhich is the science of beauty everywhere.  To this I will proceed;\nplease to give me your very best attention.\n\n\"He who has been instructed thus far in the things of love, and who has\nlearned to see the beautiful in due order and succession, when he comes\ntoward the end will suddenly perceive a nature of wondrous beauty (and\nthis, Socrates, is the final cause of all our former toils)--a nature\nwhich in the first place is everlasting, not growing and decaying, or\nwaxing and waning, in the next place not fair in one point of view and\nfoul in another, or at one time or in one relation or at one place\nfair, at another time or in another relation or at another place foul,\nas if fair to some and foul to others, or in the likeness of a face or\nhands or any other part of the bodily frame, or in any form of speech\nor knowledge, or existing in any other being; as for example, in an\nanimal, or in heaven, or in earth, or in any other place, but beauty\nonly, absolute, separate, simple, and everlasting, which without\ndiminution and without increase, or any change, is imparted to the\never-growing and perishing beauties of all other things.  He who under\nthe influence of true love rising upward from these begins to see that\nbeauty, is not far from the end.  And the true order of going or being\nled by another to the things of love, is to use the beauties of earth\nas steps along which he mounts upwards for the sake of that other\nbeauty, going from one to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from\nfair forms to fair practices, and from fair practices to fair notions,\nuntil from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty,\nand at last knows what the essence of beauty is.  This, my dear\nSocrates,\" said the stranger of Mantineia, \"is that life above all\nothers which a man should live, in the contemplation of beauty\nabsolute; a beauty which if you once beheld, you would see not to be\nafter the measure of gold, and garments, and fair boys and youths,\nwhose presence now entrances you; and you and many a one would be\ncontent to live seeing only and conversing with them without meat or\ndrink, {142} if that were possible--you only want to be with them and\nto look at them.  But what if man had eyes to see the true beauty--the\ndivine beauty, I mean, pure and clear and unalloyed, not clogged with\nthe pollutions of mortality, and all the colours and vanities of human\nlife--thither looking, and holding converse with the true beauty divine\nand simple?  Do you not see that in that communion only, beholding\nbeauty with the eye of the mind, he will be enabled to bring forth, not\nimages of beauty, but realities (for he has hold not of an image but of\na reality), and bringing forth and nourishing true virtue to become the\nfriend of God and be immortal, if mortal man may.  Would that be an\nignoble life?\" (Jowett, _Plato_, vol. ii. p. 58).\n\n\nClosely connected in subject with the _Symposium_ is the _Phaedrus_.\nAs Professor Jowett observes: \"The two dialogues together contain the\nwhole philosophy of Plato on the nature of love, which in _The\nRepublic_ and in the later writings of Plato is only introduced\nplayfully or as a figure of speech.  But in the _Phaedrus_ and\n_Symposium_ love and philosophy join hands, and one is an aspect of the\nother.  The spiritual and emotional is elevated into the ideal, to\nwhich in the _Symposium_ mankind are described as looking forward, and\nwhich in the _Phaedrus_, as well as in the _Phaedo_, they are seeking\nto recover from a former state of existence.\"\n\nWe are here introduced to one of the most famous conceptions of Plato,\nthat of _Reminiscence_, or Recollection, based upon a theory of the\nprior existence of the soul.  In the _Meno_, already alluded to,\nSocrates is representing as eliciting from one of Meno's slaves {143}\ncorrect answers to questions involving a knowledge or apprehension of\ncertain axioms of the science of mathematics, which, as Socrates\nlearns, the slave had never been taught.  Socrates argues that since he\nwas never taught these axioms, and yet actually knows them, he must\nhave known them before his birth, and concludes from this to the\nimmortality of the soul.  In the _Phaedo_ this same argument is worked\nout more fully.  As we grow up we discover in the exercise of our\nsenses that things are equal in certain respects, unequal in many\nothers; or again, we appropriate to things or acts the qualities, for\nexample, of beauty, goodness, justice, holiness.  At the same time we\nrecognise that these are _ideals_, to which in actual experience we\nnever find more than an approximation, for we never discover in any\nreally existing thing or act _absolute_ equality, or justice, or\ngoodness.  In other words, any act of judgment on our part of actual\nexperiences consists in a measuring of these experiences by standards\nwhich we give or apply to them, and which no number of experiences can\ngive to us because they do not possess or exemplify them.  We did not\nconsciously possess these notions, or ideals, or _ideas_, as he prefers\nto call them, at birth; they come into consciousness in connection with\nor in consequence of the action of the senses; but since the senses\ncould not give these ideas, the process of {144} knowledge must be a\nprocess of _Recollection_.  Socrates carries the argument a step\nfurther.  \"Then may we not say,\" he continues, \"that if, as we are\nalways repeating, there is an absolute beauty and goodness and other\nsimilar ideas or essences, and to this standard, which is now\ndiscovered to have existed in our former state, we refer all our\nsensations, and with this compare them--assuming these ideas to have a\nprior existence, then our souls must have had a prior existence, but if\nnot, not?  There is the same proof that these ideas must have existed\nbefore we were born, as that our souls existed before we were born; and\nif not the ideas, then not the souls.\"\n\nIn the _Phaedrus_ this conception of a former existence is embodied in\none of the _Myths_ in which Plato's imaginative powers are seen at\ntheir highest.  In it the soul is compared to a charioteer driving two\nwinged steeds, one mortal, the other immortal; the one ever tending\ntowards the earth, the other seeking ever to soar into the sky, where\nit may behold those blessed visions of loveliness and wisdom and\ngoodness, which are the true nurture of the soul.  When the chariots of\nthe gods go forth in mighty and glorious procession, the soul would\nfain ride forth in their train; but alas! the mortal steed is ever\nhampering the immortal, and dragging it down.\n\nIf the soul yields to this influence and descends to earth, there she\ntakes human form, but in higher {145} or lower degree, according to the\nmeasure of her vision of the truth.  She may become a philosopher, a\nking, a trader, an athlete, a prophet, a poet, a husbandman, a sophist,\na tyrant.  But whatever her lot, according to her manner of life in it,\nmay she rise, or sink still further, even to a beast or plant.\n\nOnly those souls take the form of humanity that have had _some_ vision\nof eternal truth.  And this vision they retain in a measure, even when\nclogged in mortal clay.  And so the soul of man is ever striving and\nfluttering after something beyond; and specially is she stirred to\naspiration by the sight of bodily loveliness.  Then above all comes the\ntest of good and evil in the soul.  The nature that has been corrupted\nwould fain rush to brutal joys; but the purer nature looks with\nreverence and wonder at this beauty, for it is an adumbration of the\ncelestial joys which he still remembers vaguely from the heavenly\nvision.  And thus pure and holy love becomes an opening back to heaven;\nit is a source of happiness unalloyed on earth; it guides the lovers on\nupward wings back to the heaven whence they came.\n\n\n\n\n{146}\n"]
