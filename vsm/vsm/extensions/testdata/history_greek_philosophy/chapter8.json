["CHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE ATOMISTS (_concluded_)\n\n_The laughing philosopher--Atoms and void--No god and no truth_\n\n\n[143]\n\nIII. LEUCIPPUS AND DEMOCRITUS.--Leucippus is variously called a native\nof Elea, of Abdera, of Melos, of Miletus.  He was a pupil of Zeno the\nEleatic.  [144] Democritus was a native of Abdera.  They seem to have\nbeen almost contemporary with Socrates.  The two are associated as\nthorough-going teachers of the 'Atomic Philosophy,' but Democritus,\n'the laughing philosopher,' as he was popularly called in later times,\nin distinction from Heraclitus, 'the weeping philosopher,' was much the\nmore famous.  [145] He lived to a great age.  He himself refers to his\ntravels and studies thus: \"Above all the men of my time I travelled\nfarthest, and extended my inquiries to places the most distant.  I\nvisited the most varied climates and countries, heard the largest\nnumber of learned men, nor has any one surpassed me in the gathering\ntogether of writings and their interpretation, no, not even the most\nlearned of the Egyptians, with whom I spent five years.\"  We {75} are\nalso informed that, through desire of learning, he visited Babylon and\nChaldaea, to visit the astrologers and the priests.\n\n[146]\n\nDemocritus was not less prolific as a writer than he was voracious as a\nstudent, and in him first the division of philosophy into certain great\nsections, such as physical, mathematical, ethical, was clearly [147]\ndrawn.  We are, however, mainly concerned with his teaching in its more\nstrictly philosophical aspects.  His main doctrine was professedly\nantithetical to that of the Eleatics, who, it will be remembered,\nworked out on abstract lines a theory of one indivisible, eternal,\nimmovable Being.  Democritus, on the contrary, declared for two\nco-equal elements, the Full and the Empty, or Being and Nonentity.  The\nlatter, he maintained, was as real as the former.  As we should put it,\nBody is unthinkable except by reference to space which that body does\nnot occupy, as well as to space which it does occupy; and conversely\nSpace is unthinkable except by reference to body actually or\npotentially filling or defining it.\n\nWhat Democritus hoped to get by this double or correlative system was a\nmeans of accounting for or conceiving of _change_ in nature.  The\ndifficulty with the Eleatics was, as we have seen, how to understand\nwhence or why the transition from that which absolutely is, to this\nstrange, at least apparent, system of eternal flux and transformation.\nDemocritus {76} hoped to get over this difficulty by starting as fully\nwith that which _is not_, in other words, with that which _wants_\nchange in order to have any recognisable being at all, as with that\nwhich _is_, and which therefore might be conceived as seeking and\nrequiring only to be what it is.\n\n[148]\n\nHaving got his principle of stability and his principle of change on an\nequal footing, Democritus next laid it down that all the differences\nvisible in things were differences either of shape, of arrangement, or\nof position; practically, that is, he considered that what seem, to us\nto be qualitative differences in things, _e.g._ hot or cold, sweet or\nsour, green or yellow, are only resulting impressions from different\nshapes, or different arrangements, or different modes of presentation,\namong the atoms of which things are composed.\n\nComing now to that which _is_, Democritus, as against the Eleatics,\nmaintained that this was not a unity, some one immovable, unchangeable\nexistence, but an innumerable number of atoms, invisible by reason of\ntheir smallness, which career through empty space (that which _is\nnot_), and by their union bring objects into being, by their separation\nbring these to destruction.  The action of these atoms on each other\ndepended on the manner in which they were brought into contact; but in\nany case the unity of any object was only an apparent unity, it being\nreally constituted of a multitude of interlaced and mutually related\n{77} particles, and all growth or increase of the object being\nconditioned by the introduction into the structure of additional atoms\nfrom without.\n\n[149]\n\nFor the motions of the atoms he had no anterior cause to offer, other\nthan necessity or fate.  They existed, and necessarily and always had\nexisted, in a state of whirl; and for that which always had been he\nmaintained that no preceding cause could legitimately or reasonably be\ndemanded.\n\n[150]\n\nNothing, then, could come out of nothing; all the visible structure of\nthe universe had its origin in the movements of the atoms that\nconstituted it, and conditioned its infinite changes.  The atoms, by a\nuseful but perhaps too convenient metaphor, he called the _seeds_ of\nall things.  They were infinite in number, though not infinite in the\nnumber, of their shapes.  Many atoms were similar to each other, and\nthis similarity formed a basis of union among them, a warp, so to\nspeak, or solid foundation across which the woof of dissimilar atoms\nplayed to constitute the differences of things.\n\n[151]\n\nOut of this idea of an eternal eddy or whirl Democritus developed a\ncosmogony.  The lighter atoms he imagined flew to the outmost rim of\nthe eddy, there constituting the heavenly fires and the heavenly\naether.  The heavier atoms gathered at the centre, forming successively\nair and water and the solid earth.  Not that there was only one such\n{78} system or world, but rather multitudes of them, all varying one\nfrom the other; some without sun or moon, others with greater\nluminaries than those of our system, others with a greater number.\nAll, however, had necessarily a centre; all as systems were necessarily\nspherical.\n\n[152]\n\nAs regards the atoms he conceived that when they differed in weight\nthis must be in respect of a difference in their essential size.  In\nthis he was no doubt combating the notion that the atoms say of lead or\ngold were in their substance, taking equal quantities, of greater\nweight than atoms of water or air.  The difference of weight in objects\ndepended on the proportion which the atoms in them bore to the amount\nof empty space which was interlaced with them.  On the other hand, a\npiece of iron was lighter yet harder than a piece of lead of equal\nsize, because of the special way in which the atoms in it were linked\ntogether.  There were fewer atoms in it, but they were, in consequence\nof their structure and arrangement, more tightly strung.\n\n[153]\n\nIn all this Democritus was with great resolution working out what we\nmay call a strictly mechanical theory of the universe.  Even the soul\nor life-principle in living creatures was simply a structure of the\nfinest and roundest (and therefore most nimble) atoms, with which he\ncompared the extremely attenuated dust particles visible in their\nnever-ending {79} dance in a beam of light passed into a darkened room.\nThis structure of exceeding tenuity and nimbleness was the source of\nthe motion characteristic of living creatures, and provided that\nelastic counteracting force to the inward-pressing nimble air, whereby\nwere produced the phenomena of respiration.  Every object, in fact,\nwhether living or not, kept its form and distinctive existence by its\npossession in degree of a kind of soul or spirit of resistance in its\nstructure, adequate to counteract the pressure of external forces upon\nits particles.\n\n[155]\n\nSensation and perception were forms in which these external forces\nacted upon the more nimble and lively existences, more particularly on\nliving creatures.  For every body was continually sending forth\nemanations or images resembling itself sufficiently in form and\nstructure to affect perceptive bodies with an apprehension of that form\nand structure.  These images travelled by a process of successive\ntransmission, similar to that by which wave-motions are propagated in\nwater.  They were, in other words, not movements of the _particles_ of\nthe objects, which latter must otherwise in time grow less and fade\naway, but a modification in the arrangement of the particles\nimmediately next the object, which modification reproduced itself in\nthe next following, and so on right through the medium to the\nperceptive body.\n\n{80}\n\n[156]\n\nThese images tended by extension in all directions to reach vast\ndimensions at times, and to influence the minds of men in sleep and on\nother occasions in strange ways.  Hence men imagined gods, and\nattributed those mighty phenomena of nature--earthquakes, tempests,\nlightning and thunder, and dire eclipses of sun and moon, to the\nvaguely visible powers which they imagined they saw.  There was indeed\na soul or spirit of the universe, as there was a soul or spirit of\nevery individual thing that constituted it.  But this was only a finer\nsystem of atoms after all.  All else is convention or dream; the only\nrealities are Atoms and Emptiness, Matter and Space.\n\n[157]\n\nOf absolute verity through the senses we know nothing; our perceptions\nare only conventional interpretations of we know not what.  For to\nother living creatures these same sensations have other meanings than\nthey have to us, and even the same person is not always affected alike\nby the same thing; which then is the true of two differing perceptions\nwe cannot say.  And therefore either there is no such thing as truth,\nor, at all events, we know through the senses nothing of it.  The only\ngenuine knowledge is that which transcends appearances, and reasons out\nwhat is, irrespective of appearances,--in other words, the only genuine\nknowledge is that of the (atomic) philosopher.  And his knowledge is\n{81} the result of the happy mixture of his atoms whereby all is in\nequal balance, neither too hot nor too cold.  Such a man seeing in the\nmind's eye the whole universe a tissue of whirling and interlacing\natoms, with no real mystery or terror before or after, will live a life\nof cheerful fearlessness, undisturbed by terrors of a world to come or\nof powers unseen.  His happiness is not in feastings or in gold, but in\na mind at peace.  And three human perfections he will seek to attain:\nto reason rightly, to speak graciously, to do his duty.\n\n\n\n\n{82}\n"]
