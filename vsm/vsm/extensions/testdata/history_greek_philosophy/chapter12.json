["CHAPTER XII\n\nSOCRATES (_concluded_)\n\n_The dialectic method--Instruction through humiliation--Justice and\nutility--Righteousness transcending rule_\n\n\nIt must not be imagined that anywhere in the recorded conversations of\nSocrates can we find thus in so many words expounded his fundamental\ndoctrine.  Socrates was not an expositor but a questioner; he\ndisclaimed the position of a teacher, he refused to admit that any were\nhis pupils or disciples.  But his questioning had two sides, each in\nits way leading people on to an apprehension of the ideal in existence.\nThe first side may be called the negative or destructive, the second,\nthe positive or constructive.  In the first, whose object was to break\ndown all formalism, all mere regard for rules or traditions or\nunreasoned maxims, his method had considerable resemblance to that of\nthe Sophists; like them he descended not infrequently to what looked\nvery like quibbling and word-play.  As Aristotle observes, the\ndialectic method differed from that of the Sophists not so much in its\nform, as in the purpose for which it was employed.  The end of the\n{116} Sophists was to confuse, the end of Socrates was through\nconfusion to reach a more real, because a more reasoned certainty; the\nSophists sought to leave the impression that there was no such thing as\ntruth; he wished to lead people to the conviction that there was a far\ndeeper truth than they were as yet possessed of.\n\nA specimen of his manner of conversation preserved for us by Xenophon\n(_Memor_. IV. ii.) will make the difference clearer.  Euthydemus was a\nyoung man who had shown great industry in forming a collection of wise\nsayings from poets and others, and who prided himself on his superior\nwisdom because of his knowledge of these.  Socrates skilfully manages\nto get the ear of this young man by commending him for his collection,\nand asks him what he expects his learning to help him to become?  A\nphysician?  No, Euthydemus answers.  An architect?  No.  And so in like\nmanner with other practical skills,--the geometrician's, astronomer's,\nprofessional reciter's.  None of these he discovers is what Euthydemus\naims at.  He hopes to become a great politician and statesman.  Then of\ncourse he hopes to be a just man himself?  Euthydemus flatters himself\nhe is that already.  \"But,\" says Socrates, \"there must be certain acts\nwhich are the proper products of justice, as of other functions or\nskills?\"--\"No doubt.\"--\"Then of course you can tell us what {117} those\nacts or products are?\"--\"Of course I can, and the products of injustice\nas well.\"--\"Very good; then suppose we write down in two opposite\ncolumns what acts are products of justice and what of injustice.\"--\"I\nagree,\" says Euthydemus.--\"Well now, what of falsehood?  In which\ncolumn shall we put it?\"--\"Why, of course in the unjust column.\"--\"And\ncheating?\"--\"In the same column.\"--\"And stealing?\"--\"In it too.\"--\"And\nenslaving?\"--\"Yes.\"--\"Not one of these can go to the just\ncolumn?\"--\"Why, that would be an unheard-of thing.\"\n\n\"Well but,\" says Socrates, \"suppose a general has to deal with some\nenemy of his country that has done it great wrong; if he conquer and\nenslave this enemy, is that wrong?\"--\"Certainly not.\"--\"If he carries\noff the enemy's goods or cheats him in his strategy, what about these\nacts?\"--\"Oh, of course they are quite right.  But I thought you were\ntalking about deceiving or ill-treating friends.\"--\"Then in some cases\nwe shall have to put these very same acts in both columns?\"--\"I suppose\nso.\"\n\n\"Well, now, suppose we confine ourselves to friends.  Imagine a general\nwith an army under him discouraged and disorganised.  Suppose he tells\nthem that reserves are coming up, and by cheating them into this belief\nhe saves them from their discouragement, and enables them to win a\nvictory.  What about this cheating of one's friends?\"--\"Why, I {118}\nsuppose we shall have to put this too on the just side.\"--\"Or suppose a\nlad needs medicine, but refuses to take it, and his father cheats him\ninto the belief that it is something nice, and getting him to take it,\nsaves his life; what about that cheat?\"--\"That will have to go to the\njust side too.\"--\"Or suppose you find a friend in a desperate frenzy,\nand steal his sword from him, for fear he should kill himself; what do\nyou say to that theft?\"--\"That will have to go there too.\"--\"But I\nthought you said there must be no cheating of friends?\"--\"Well, I must\ntake it all back, if you please.\"--\"Very good.  But now there is\nanother point I should like to ask you.  Whether do you think the man\nmore unjust who is a voluntary violator of justice, or he who is an\ninvoluntary violator of it?\"--\"Upon my word, Socrates, I no longer have\nany confidence in my answers.  For the whole thing has turned out to be\nexactly the contrary of what I previously imagined.  However, suppose I\nsay that the voluntary deceiver is the more unjust.\"--\"Do you consider\nthat justice is a matter of knowledge just as much (say) as\nwriting?\"--\"Yes, I do.\"--\"Well now, which do you consider the better\nskilled as a writer, the man who makes a mistake in writing or in\nreading what is written, because he chooses to do so, or the man who\ndoes so because he can't help it?\"--\"Oh, the first; because he can put\nit right whenever he likes.\"--\"Very {119} well, if a man in the same\nway breaks the rule of right, knowing what he is doing, while another\nbreaks the same rule because he can't help it, which by analogy must be\nthe better versed in justice?\"--\"The first, I suppose.\"--\"And the man\nwho is better versed in justice must be the juster man?\"--\"Apparently\nso; but really, Socrates, I don't know where I am.  I have been\nflattering myself that I was in possession of a philosophy which could\nmake a good and able man of me.  But how great, think you, must now be\nmy disappointment, when I find myself unable to answer the simplest\nquestion on the subject?\"\n\nMany other questions are put to him, tending to probe his\nself-knowledge, and in the end he is brought to the conclusion that\nperhaps he had better hold his tongue, for it seems he knows nothing at\nall.  And so he went away deeply despondent, despising himself as an\nabsolute dolt.  \"Now many,\" adds Xenophon, \"when brought into this\ncondition by Socrates, never came near him again.  But Euthydemus\nconcluded that his only hope of ever being worth anything was in seeing\nas much of Socrates as he could, and so he never quitted his side as\nlong as he had a chance, but tried to follow his mode of living.  And\nSocrates, when he perceived this to be his temper, no longer tormented\nhim, but sought with all simplicity and clearness to {120} show him\nwhat he deemed it best for him to do and think.\"\n\nWas this cross-examination mere 'tormenting' with a purpose, or can we\ndiscover underlying it any hint of what Socrates deemed to be the truth\nabout justice?\n\nLet us note that throughout he is in search of a _definition_, but that\nas soon as any attempt is made to define or classify any particular\ntype of action as just or unjust, _special circumstances_ are suggested\nwhich overturn the classification.  Let us note further that while the\nimmediate result is apparently only to confuse, the remoter but more\npermanent result is to raise a suspicion of any hard and fast\ndefinitions, and to suggest that there is something deeper in life than\nlanguage is adequate to express, a 'law in the members,' a living\nprinciple for good, which transcends forms and maxims, and which alone\ngives real value to acts.  Note further the suggestion that this living\nprinciple has a character analogous to the knowledge or skill of an\naccomplished artificer; it has relation on the one hand to law, as a\nprinciple binding on the individual, it has relation on the other hand\nto _utility_, as expressing itself, not in words, but in acts\nbeneficial to those concerned.  Hence the Socratic formula, Justice is\nequivalent to the _Lawful_ on the one hand, to the _Useful_ on the\nother.\n\n{121}\n\nSocrates had thus solved by anticipation the apparently never-ending\ncontroversy about morality.  Is it a matter imposed by God upon the\nheart and conscience of each individual?  Is it dictated by the general\nsense of the community?  Is it the product of Utility?  The Socratic\nanswer would be that it is all three, and that all three mean\nultimately the same thing.  What God prescribes is what man when he is\ntruly man desires; and what God prescribes and man desires is that\nwhich is good and useful for man.  It is not a matter for verbal\ndefinition but for vital realisation; the true morality is that which\n_works_; the ideally desirable, is ultimately the only possible, course\nof action, for all violations of it are ultimately suicidal.\n\nNote finally the suggestion that the man who _knows_ (in Socrates'\nsense of knowledge) what is right, shows only more fully his\nrighteousness when he voluntarily sins; it is the 'unwilling sinner'\nwho is the wrongdoer.  When we consider this strange doctrine in\nrelation to the instances given,--the general with his army, the father\nwith his son, the prudent friend with his friend in desperate\nstraits,--we see that what is meant is that 'sin' in the real sense is\nnot to be measured or defined by conformity or otherwise to some formal\nstandard, at least in the case of those who _know_, that is, in the\ncase of men who have realised goodness in its true nature in {122}\ntheir characters and lives.  As St. Paul expressed it (Rom. xiii. 10),\n\"Love is the fulfilling of the law.\"  Or again (Gal. v. 23), after\nenumerating the 'fruits of the spirit'--love, joy, peace,\nlongsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance--he\nadds, \"Against such there is no law.\"\n\nIn the domain of life, not less than in that of the arts, the highest\nactivity does not always or necessarily take the form of conformity to\nrule.  There are critical moments when rules fail, when, in fact,\nobedience to rule would mean disobedience to that higher law, of which\nrules and formulae are at best only an adumbration.  The originality of\nthe great musician or painter consists in just such transcendence of\naccepted formulae; this is why he invariably encounters opposition and\nobloquy from the learned conventional pedants of his time.  And in the\ndomain of morals the martyrs, reformers, prophets are in like manner\n'willing sinners.'  They are denounced, persecuted, crucified; for are\nthey not disturbers of society; do they not unsettle young men; do they\nnot come, as Christ came, not to bring peace into the world, but a\nsword?  And thus it is that the willing sinners of one generation are\nthe martyrs and heroes of the next.  Through their life and death a\nricher meaning has been given to the law of beauty or of rectitude,\nonly, alas! in its turn to be translated into new conventions, new\n{123} formulae, which shall in due time require new martyrs to\ntranscend them.  And thus, on the other hand, the perfectly honest\nsticklers for the old and common-place, unwilling sinners all\nunconscious of their sin, are fated to bear in history the brand of men\nwho have persecuted the righteous without cause.  To each, according to\nthe strange sad law of life, time brings its revenges.\n\n\n\n\n{124}\n"]
